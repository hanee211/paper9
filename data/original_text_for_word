director bob sheets saidthere's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the yucatan peninsula and gets back in open water as gilbert moved away from the yucatan peninsula wednesday night the hurricane formed a double eye two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again one eye was about eight miles wide and the second about 25 miles wide said hurricane center meteorologist jesse moore this is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane moved back over the water and we do expect intensification he said only two category 5 hurricanes have hit the united states _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in florida and hurricane camille that devastated the mississippi coast in 1969

hurricane gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off africa to a ferocious killer in the gulf of mexico was fueled by a combination of heat moisture and wind that baffles forecasters it's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time gil clark of the national hurricane center said thursday it doesn't happen very often how it develops we don't know gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters sept 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of africa we get 50 or 60 of these off africa every summer about one of six develop said clark by sept 8 the system became a depression it reached tropical storm status by saturday and a hurricane sunday a tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling when sustained winds reach 39 mph the system becomes a named tropical storm it reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph why gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't is a mystery more or less said university of miami meteorology professor rainer bleck the first part of the summer we were biting our nails wondering why these other disturbances didn't develop he said thursday that's something meteorologists would like to know more about but the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins and they know that development is sparked when winds converge and that growth is affected by time and place if that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere the bottom 10000 feet or so this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation bleck said if clouds form the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence pattern that strengthens it he said adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the earth's rotation eventually a vortex is created any time you contract an air mass they will start spinning that's what makes the tornadoes hurricanes and blizzards those winter storms bleck said hurricanes are useful to the climate machine their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere he said the sun puts energy into the water the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere that has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere when the depression that would become gilbert neared barbados warm atlantic waters nurtured it this time of year in the northwest caribbean is best for development clark said if you get a storm in this area in september when the water's warmest it can just explode this is where camille formed and exploded referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the gulf coast it is an exciting thing to watch if you're on the beach watching the storm surge it's a different story he said the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure measured at 2613 inches tuesday night that broke the 2635 inches

caused coastal flooding in puerto rico in the dominican republic all domestic flights and flights to and from puerto rico and miami were canceled forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the dominican republic and haiti as it moved south of hispaniola the caribbean island they share and headed west it's still gaining strength it's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the caribbean for a long time said hal gerrish forecaster at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla at 3 pm edt the center of the hurricane

pay for damage from tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates industry spokesmen and analysts said wednesday only 15 percent to 20 percent of california homeowners have earthquake insurance which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100000 home according to industry spokesmen the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said that in the san francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance the organization estimated residential damages from tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the bay area with between $100 million to $150 million insured insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices said hugh strawn director of catastrophe services at the property loss research bureau in schaumburg ill insurance companies attempted wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay in addition to home damage the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage broken glass theft and burglary business interruption due to electrical outages water damage and possibly workers compensation some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more from the quake but industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims we don't think any company is going to have problems paying claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the american insurance association a washington-based trade group the insurers actually could benefit industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from hurricane hugo which hammered south carolina and other parts of the southeastern united states earlier this month an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term the analysts said there's a perception that this could turn the cycle that this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an analyst with bear stearns & co inc in new york despite their predictions for the long run the analysts warned that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing it's going to be a meaningful loss perhaps as big as hugo said robert glasspiegel an analyst

california where many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred under a 1985 california law insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high industry spokesmen said they estimated that at least 25 percent and probably many more business properties are insured because of its high costs earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial proposition 103 approved by california voters last year the proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback in insurance rates insurers and state regulators are battling over the rates and how they're set

edition metro part b page 6 column 1 editorial writers desk 652 words a special session with speed gov george deukmejian is right to call the legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last tuesday's northern california earthquake with congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible and as soon as is practical deukmejian should be commended as well for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape the governor is wrong however in his campaign to distance himself from the california department of transportation on the issue of what caused the nimitz freeway in oakland to collapse and what could or should have been done to have prevented it while deukmejian is not necessarily blaming caltrans he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as what did you know and when did you know it the governor's answer which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake was that no one in caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake he was shocked that such a thing would happen this has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that california stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase there is keen interest of course in why the freeway collapsed and whether something might have been done the major reason is so that california can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake there has been no widespread outcry against the governor while the department of transportation and the state transportation commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds the governor also sets general state priorities the governor complained on sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake but no one who has lived in california more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake california is on the edge of earthquake-related technology but still does not know everything that needs to be known the state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from tuesday oct 17 but it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality in the bay area that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage but face massive obstacles in getting to work the governor and legislative leaders will meet again next monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session it almost certainly would include a temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the office of emergency services for allocation to local governments but the need could well exceed the present reserve the scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge the governor and legislature should not wait too long to start the session although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to california the legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained editorial

some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action mr bush and his aides were accused of responding too

announced that mr bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 630 am from chief of staff john sununu by noon mr bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster proclamation received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters mr bush himself

highways such as the section of interstate 880 that collapsed in oakland generally don't have insurance coverage industry officials say the bay bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds however the bridge which charges a $1 toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including fireman's fund corp based in novato calif and cigna corp based in philadelphia earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william yankus an analyst with conning & co a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up $325 to $102625 general re corp up $275 to $8650 aetna up $2375 to $5950 and marsh & mclennan inc up $3125 to $75875 still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated i think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said oppenheimer & co analyst myron picoult he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo british west german scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster although it's unclear how much exposure the london market will face uk underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to us catastrophe coverage jack byrne chairman of fireman's fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire orin kramer an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the 1906 san francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of $58 billion he is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo ap890922-0071 ap-nr-09-22-89 0634edt u i britain-blast 3rdld-writethru a0526 09-22 0467 britain-blast

assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks if we designate places as being low-risk categories then it is likely they will be attacked given the way that the ira is forced to operate o'neill

to gourmets it is estimated there are more than 5000 different chinese dishes in canton 125 miles northwest of shenzhen chefs specialize in some of the more exotic chinese dishes such as cat stew bear paws chicken feet and a famed snake dish - dragon and tiger locked in battle - made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat and garnished with 20 spices lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals however many chinese who earn an average $32 a month are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants in shenzhen a chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have

officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for mcdonald's hamburgers opening the second mcdonald's restaurant in moscow along with a 12-storey office block mr george cohon head of mcdonald's canada could well be described as the russian authorities' idea of a model investor mcdonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serve russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for russian gratitude mr viktor khlystun the agriculture minister praised the fact that mcdonald's gets most of its supplies from inside russia after setting up a dollars 45m processing plant outside moscow he also thanked mcdonald's for providing jobs a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry and finally for what he described as 'the most delicious food' but despite the jolly opening ceremony - with big macs musicians playing the balalaika and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant m - life has been tough for mcdonald's since it opened its first restaurant in moscow 3 1/2 years ago although the first moscow restaurant is the busiest mcdonald's in the world the plunging rouble high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to mcdonald's management who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial dollars 50m investment 'it will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants what happens to the rouble what happens to raw materials that we buy we don't have an estimate of how long it will take there are too many variables' said mr cohon apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor the mcdonald's office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate

taste their first beeg mak gamburgers picking them apart to marvel at the fixin's some expressed wonder at the speedy service -- only an hour in line -- while others heralded the event as the first evidence that president mikhail s gorbachev's economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average muscovite although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures the arrival of the fast-food chain here -- 14 years after a canadian mcdonald's official broached the idea with soviet officials at the 1976 montreal olympics -- was without doubt a major event most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it even though some of them gave the big mac sandwich a mixed review it tasted very i would say unusual lubov sereda 45 said with a smile everything was very soft and mild but those strawberry milk cocktails well her husband put in flashing a thumbs-up sign it was very interesting that gamburger zvetlana generotova 25 said leaving with a large paper bag filled with take-out food also a new concept here i certainly want my family to try it at least once russians say gamburger because they pronounce western words that begin with h as though they begin with g another customer victor kunyasev said well my wife makes better food but it was nice a good place to take a break and grab a bite to eat some reported waiting up to 1 hour and 45 minutes to be served but most did not seem to mind in honor of the grand opening a brigade of workers distributed mcdonald's flags and pins entertainers performed on the accordion and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the soviet hammer and sickle the world's largest mcdonald's with 27 cash registers and a seating capacity of 900 brings to moscow not only hamburgers french fries and shakes called milk cocktails here but also a living lesson in western-style marketing at training sessions before opening day cashiers were taught the importance of greeting customers cheerfully of saying please and thank you -- all of which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service at most of moscow's dingy state cafes this is very different from anything i've ever done before cashier larissa lebedeva said lebedeva 25 who formerly worked as deputy director of a small food store said that to be this polite and to have everything this clean is new for the workers as well as for the customers sam yahel from mcdonald's in atlanta who helped train the 630 soviet workers said the soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants most of the soviet workers had never tasted a western-style hamburger they practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and different colored poker chips in place of onions tomatoes and pickles the soviet union is definitely a different world yahel said our food and our standards -- it's all new for example we had to teach our employees that when there were still crumbs on the counter it needed to be wiped off again while most of the soviet workers trained for a matter of days the four soviet managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs they graduated from the canadian institute of hamburgerology the moscow mcdonald's will be open for 12 hours a day beginning at 10 am and will be able they say to serve more than 15000 customers a day on wednesday though it stayed open an extra two hours and served a mcdonald's record 30000 meals the previous record for opening-day transactions was 9100

that has come into the soviet union in recent years accepts only hard currencies meaning that it caters primarily to foreigners the mcdonald's prices are high compared to the state restaurants where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble the big mac costs 375 rubles or about $5 at the official exchange rate and dinner out for the family can come to two days' wages for the average soviet worker mcdonald's employees are paid 150 rubles an hour with a chance for an increase of up to 50 kopecks in three months' time the staff was chosen from 25000 applicants canadian and american officials who have helped train the soviet personnel know that the allure of working for a western firm was a drawing factor but they nonetheless expect a 20% turnover rate twice their normal average mcdonald's invested $50 million in setting up the restaurant and a food processing plant in a moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties to sesame-seed buns soviet farmers who are supplying most of the products have been given special training and disease-resistant seed for potatoes and cucumbers the extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much as 25% of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer despite all of the planning some shortages still affect the operation coffee is not on the menu for example because supplies cannot be guaranteed the joint venture agreement between mcdonald's of canada and the moscow city council calls for 20 restaurants though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second mcdonald's will open is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas of russian orthodox churches it will be a sign that capitalism is making real inroads in the communist capital mcdonald's officials say it is not a question that worries them or their soviet counterparts there weren't many ideological discussions during these negotiations said marc winer 43 a native of nashua nh who is general director of the moscow outlet the soviets understood that the food was going to move very efficiently from the field to the mouth that is more important to them right now than almost

which has asia's fastest-growing economy had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from seoul on terms south korea may be one of mcdonald's most promising foreign markets business analysts say the country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise a middle class hamburger-related fast-food sales in south korea totaled $875 million last year a 30% rise from 1986 according to the ministry of finance analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon the business is likely to profit from the 1988 olympic games in seoul in september and from an anticipated post-olympic economic boom here however the competition is heating up and there is a good possibility that south korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket an official for the south korea chamber of commerce and industry says the competition besides wendy's international's 11 shops and six of burger king a unit of pillsbury co includes home-grown burger chains mcdonald's strategy is to take

rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper more oldfashioned approach a brief advertising campaign in newspapers distribution of fliers and word of mouth mr sifri says the emphasis will be on developing mcdonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in south korea attention will be given to attracting children he adds mr ahn says mcdonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the harvard-trained accountant in 1984 two years later mcdonald's and mr ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form mcahn mcdonald's struggled with the government over mcahn's royalty payments to the us partner -- the issue was resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products the import question came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value mcdonald's said even mcdonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape

announced he wants the 41-year-old indiana senator to be the republican nominee for vice president those who have known the quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life dan and marilyn quayle met as law students in indianapolis married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period one of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit said indianapolis attorney william r neale treasurer of quayle's 1986 re-election campaign he's the same nice guy he was in law school neale who grew up with marilyn tucker quayle in indianapolis introduced dan quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the indiana university law school in the early 1970s dan quayle who grew up in huntington graduated from depauw university a small liberal arts college in greencastle ind before going to work in the indiana attorney general's office in 1970 daniel f evans also a law school classmate of dan quayle said he doesn't expect quayle's national candidacy to change him i think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are even after this said evans who was chairman of quayle's 1986 campaign friends said the quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in washington his family

privacy is going to be the biggest minus said mrs quayle 39 quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if bush offered it tucker was fascinated by the idea quayle said benjamin was ambiguous but he thought secret service agents might be able to help him on tests at school mrs quayle said corinne didn't like the prospect of having

whenever he heard the indiana senator speak i'd say `there stands the next thomas jefferson' and added warner he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather thomas jefferson of virginia former president gerald ford made the comparison with kennedy a democrat in 1960 the american people voted for john f kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as dan quayle said ford john kennedy had been in the house and senate 14 years before he was elected president and dan quayle's had 12 years what quayle thinks of those references isn't known but he doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol robert redford whether indeed he looks like redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder in the parlance of politics it's an issue they are both male they are both blond the so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 senate race and redford took umbrage the actor who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in the candidate sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature quayle said the news media had made the comparison not he and after he was elected sent redford an autographed picture of himself and this week he told reporters he considered the so-called redford look a stigma he wasn't asked how he felt about being painted as another jefferson or kennedy meanwhile fellow senators were trying to publicize quayle who at 41 hasn't had a chance to become a legend he is a republican vice presidential candidate who is not as spiro agnew

reform or the inf treaty dan quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch supporter of the reagan revolution and now he is ready to carry that revolution forward and believe me he is ready and just let the democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign just let them try now i don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience he's got plenty of experience plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools experience in increasing spending year after year after year in massachusetts and i just don't believe the american people want that kind of experience in the white house it sounds like a dukak-eyed idea to me but dan quayle's got experience too he's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all americans and the future of our country that is 12 more years of national experience than michael dukakis _ and he is running for president as i said at the start dan quayle is a man i know and trust i am honored to nominate him for vice president mr chairman and

supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young indiana senator but the dream faded overnight bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the republicans by withdrawing from the ticket though he found himself in danger of fizzling thursday quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a bush administration let's go on to victory quayle exhorted as the crowd erupted in cheers the 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy bush who followed his running mate to the podium said he was proud to have dan quayle at my side the two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through indiana ohio and illinois but beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened quayle's candidacy just as it was launched retired maj gen wendell c phillippi _ who worked for quayle's grandfather eugene c pulliam as managing editor of the indianapolis news _ said he contacted the national guard on behalf of quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended him very highly the news reported quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school a bush aide said the matter was discussed with the indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the guard bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping quayle from the ticket as some republicans suggested quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall it was a daunting change for the senator whose youthful vigor rapid political rise striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of john f kennedy quayle alluded to the national guard issue during his speech saying he was proud of the six years he served he also addressed his relative anonymity many this week have asked `who is dan quayle' the people of indiana know me and now the nation will those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition sen bob dole of kansas who placed quayle's name in nomination stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job he's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator that is 12 more years of national experience than michael dukakis and he is running for president dole said sen alan simpson of wyoming one of those who seconded the nomination said quayle would bring vim vigor and vitality to the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign whether quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen others notably democratic vice presidential nominee

inaccurate i didn't hold that job for two years quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane earlier however quayle spokesman david prosperi called the revelation of the error by the plain dealer of cleveland a cheap shot quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state attorney general's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the indiana national guard quayle a 1969 graduate of depauw university was attending indiana university law school at the time m stanton evans then an editor with the indianapolis news helped arrange his job interview with the state evans worked for eugene c pulliam quayle's grandfather and publisher of the news at no point in any of this did dan quayle ask any favors or use any influence said evans now with the national journalism center in washington dc he wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator he was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits it's a nothing story evans said theodore sendak the attorney general at the time recently had surgery and is unable to comment according to his son timothy sendak patricia gifford a marion superior court judge who was then an assistant attorney general said friday that prior to the establishment of the consumer protection division all complaints and inquiries were handled by me the legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was dan quayle her statement was released by the quayle campaign the consumer protection division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products false claims in ads faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud in 1980 quayle referred to himself as a vietnam-era veteran in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent birch bayh in a senate race quayle who enlisted in the indiana national guard dropped the reference after objections by some vietnam combat veterans in that same election which he won quayle said he was on active duty for several periods during his tenure in the guard the statement referred to periods when quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp

press writer washington ap dan quayle is likely to be a man on the outside in george bush's white house following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts say encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies quayle enters a bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe gop areas quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that walter mondale and even bush had some scholars feel dan quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more one thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown with quayle it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals said ryan barilleaux a professor of political science at miami university in oxford ohio who studies the american presidency bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign when asked bush employed the stock lines that quayle would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military service academic record and personal life the president-elect told reporters quayle would have access to the same papers information and intelligence that is available to the president but he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give quayle quayle says bush has talked to him about heading a space council and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts i will be a very close adviser to the president quayle said but that's not the way everyone sees it both bush and mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns barilleaux notes dan quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the bush campaign he doesn't have his own big reputation on capitol hill dan quayle has no friends in a bush white house except george bush barilleaux says they're going to give him a lot of window dressing a space council drug task force but he's going to be a man on the outside not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis except on a pro forma basis but eddie mahe jr a gop consultant who worked with the bush campaign says bush is likely to give quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign vindication demands that both of them will want to prove how right the decision was mahe says democrats portrayed quayle during the campaign as a lightweight a man with little or no legislative accomplishments untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency even some members of quayle's own party were dismayed at bush's choice quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the holocaust and his declaration i didn't live in this century norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute says quayle while not the world's leading intellectual is not a complete dummy he was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared ornstein says i think he's immature he's not stupid ornstein says but quayle comes to the white house with a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate ornstein says that's going to give him a good deal to overcome it's going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself that's going to be difficult given the office both barilleaux and stephen hess of the brookings institution see parallels in quayle's vice presidency and those of richard nixon and spiro agnew the choice of nixon was viewed as a move by dwight eisenhower to appease the party's right wing and agnew was seen as a political nonentity the natural response is to use him quayle sparingly as nixon did with agnew in 1968 hess says however quayle has four years to prove himself and i think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned how much he's acted responsibly how far he's come from the campaign of 1988 quayle admits the campaign was a learning process after the controversies subsided quayle declared his independence from his bush handlers saying he would be his own man he became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from washington and to deliver the party's scripted message soon he dropped off the front pages and although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news he played the role of loyal no 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity we have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all that's what we're supposed to be he told reporters that willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a bush white house mahe feels since bush wants a private adviser whose experience and opinion he respected who has never had another agenda dan quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone mahe says you're never going to see dan quayle telling tales out of school la111289-0035 133531 november 12 1989 sunday home edition view part e page 1 column 4 view desk 879 words roger simon a strategy that bears repeating by roger simon one year after his election dan quayle has achieved all he ever wanted he has become dull his coming-out party last sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news he went on meet the press this was no small thing during his entire campaign for the vice presidency quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows he didn't appear on meet the press or this week with david brinkley or face the nation and he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news his every slip his every gaffe his every goof was news he was the stuff of nightly tv monologues a lot of people feel quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job jay leno once said that joke was not only funny but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency mike dukakis tried to make quayle a major issue and failed but some also felt that quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications so when quayle got to washington he got there with one goal support the president and make himself a very small target stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992 we had asked him on the show a number of times christie basham senior producer of meet the press told me but he always declined we renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show he changed his mind and said he would it was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest and it says something about dan quayle's reputation that he would be considered above and beyond the usual guest normally a vice president would not be that's because vice presidents don't actually do anything they don't run departments or make policy they mostly wait for heads of state to expire as george bush once joked about his duties as vice president you die i fly but quayle was considered a hot tv guest because he might screw up he might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the president none of this happened the show was uneventful quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news some major newspapers didn't even bother to do a story the next day it was everything quayle had hoped for i asked david beckwith his spokesman why quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show well he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job beckwith said he wanted to solidify his relationship with the president and learn the inner workings of the administration so why go on now it seemed like a particularly opportune week beckwith said george bush and mikhail gorbachev had announced a summit central america was back in the news and oh yeah bush had said dan quayle would be on the ticket in 1992 and marlin fitzwater bush's spokesman called and just suggested we do the show beckwith said the selection of dan quayle had been bush's first major and some would say only decision of his presidential campaign he had input from a number of people but quayle was george bush's choice many thought it was a terrible choice but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow and bush's announcement that quayle would be his running mate again was bush's way of saying i didn't screw up the first time i made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was i am making it again and now was the time for quayle to go on meet the press and show everybody just how right george bush had been i asked beckwith if quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone he was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions beckwith said a lot of the time you never know what you're going to get into sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious a typical example of a non-serious question often put to dan quayle is why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you but quayle got no questions like that last week i asked christie basham of meet the press if quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be yes basham said but almost all the guests do quayle's questioners were david broder of the washington post and elizabeth drew of the new yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions if quayle had been told the questioners were going to be hunter thompson and jimmy breslin i have a feeling quayle might have come down with laryngitis after the show fitzwater called quayle to express his and presumably the president's pleasure at how quayle had handled himself quayle had said very little and he had said it very well the very limitations of a vice president's role don't make him an ideal guest beckwith admitted almost by job description a vice president is not permitted to make serious news and quayle knows his future is in sticking to that during the 1988 campaign i interviewed quayle and i came away with one overwhelming impression dan quayle would run for president in 1996 and he will do so i believe by being a vice president who keeps his head down his nose clean and his life dull after all it worked

picture-postcard town of victorian houses and clean streets don't care what jay leno or the polls or the democrats or disgruntled republicans have been saying about dan quayle despite the fact that president bush's health problems have made the vice president a national preoccupation to people here he's just danny quayle from polk street -- a really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper living quayle's hometown flushed with pride cover story he is the most important person ever to come out of this town and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the premiere dan quayle memorabilia exhibit to those who say quayle does not merit his own exhibition quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the united states we're preserving history says david schenkel the exhibition coordinator a century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him if so huntington will be ready relatives former classmates and longtime neighbors of quayle have donated yearbooks report cards poems letters his little league uniform a coffee cup he drank from a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched wrote signed or posed for the vice president's mother corinne donated a lock of his baby hair the 1972 indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of quayle then an aide to indiana gov edgar whitcomb accompanying her to the race and a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she saved from one of quayle's floors the exhibition which runs through may 20 was put together by the dan quayle commemorative foundation a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and they say least-understood vice president he has taken such a bad rap said schenkel a foundation board member if people knew him they'd see he's a regular person if they had a chance to sit down with dan as a neighbor they would see the extremely good values in the man these are the faithful who have long since stopped expecting good press on their man instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity describing the best coverage as more upbeat or halfway decent they defend the relatively young age of quayle who turned 44 in february all he needs is a little seasoning his limited experience look at what they said about truman -- he was a haberdasher and his passion for golf he has to have some form of relaxation but they are careful not to stretch the superlatives the description nice comes up a lot he's not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is says dottie watson president of the republican women of huntington county he's a very nice person a capable person everybody i know says he can do it that is not to say some people don't have some friendly advice for quayle if he would slow down talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying i don't think people would take him the way they do said jean anne drabenstot the owner of nick's kitchen quayle's favorite restaurant hayden schenkel chairman of the huntington county democratic party and a distant cousin of david schenkel says some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the united states most of the democrats and even some of the republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president and they're 100 percent behind him but in all due respect we sure hope nothing happens to president bush quayle has declined an invitation to attend the tribute citing a busy schedule nonetheless most of huntington's 17000 residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition which tracks his life from infancy through law school from the senate to the vice presidency the free exhibition has turned a gray room in the town's public library into a virtual dan quayle museum the display patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly ordinary there is dan quayle and his brother chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at christmas there is dan quayle with his vacation bible school class dan quayle with the high school golf team dan quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with sharon mceachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the fort wayne country club it is all very 50s very middle american almost surreal in its innocence there are windows into the workings of the quayle family too for example his father james signed the report cards when dan brought home poor grades and his mother signed when he brought home good ones and there are letters and poems that he wrote which only go to show that one does not have to be a yeats to make it in politics dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on nov 22 1960 when he was 13 years old my dad is very very nice but he is not made of sugar and spice sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed but at other times he is as cheerful as a bird the exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper announcement of dan and marilyn quayle's wedding the wooden quayle & quayle shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here and assorted campaign souvenirs including the official air sickness bag from the 1988 republican national convention ultimately the foundation wants to build a repository for the memorabilia it has already organized a walking tour of historic quayle sites like the white ranch-style house where he spent his early days and nick's kitchen where he likes to order tenderloins fries and a milkshake we want everybody to know he's a winner -- i don't care what the newspapers say said marge hiner one of the exhibit organizers what a role model for our children to know that you can be a normal person come from a normal
