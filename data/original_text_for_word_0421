director bob sheets saidthere's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the yucatan peninsula and gets back in open water as gilbert moved away from the yucatan peninsula wednesday night the hurricane formed a double eye two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again one eye was about eight miles wide and the second about 25 miles wide said hurricane center meteorologist jesse moore this is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane moved back over the water and we do expect intensification he said only two category 5 hurricanes have hit the united states _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in florida and hurricane camille that devastated the mississippi coast in 1969

hurricane gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off africa to a ferocious killer in the gulf of mexico was fueled by a combination of heat moisture and wind that baffles forecasters it's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time gil clark of the national hurricane center said thursday it doesn't happen very often how it develops we don't know gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters sept 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of africa we get 50 or 60 of these off africa every summer about one of six develop said clark by sept 8 the system became a depression it reached tropical storm status by saturday and a hurricane sunday a tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling when sustained winds reach 39 mph the system becomes a named tropical storm it reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph why gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't is a mystery more or less said university of miami meteorology professor rainer bleck the first part of the summer we were biting our nails wondering why these other disturbances didn't develop he said thursday that's something meteorologists would like to know more about but the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins and they know that development is sparked when winds converge and that growth is affected by time and place if that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere the bottom 10000 feet or so this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation bleck said if clouds form the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence pattern that strengthens it he said adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the earth's rotation eventually a vortex is created any time you contract an air mass they will start spinning that's what makes the tornadoes hurricanes and blizzards those winter storms bleck said hurricanes are useful to the climate machine their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere he said the sun puts energy into the water the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere that has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere when the depression that would become gilbert neared barbados warm atlantic waters nurtured it this time of year in the northwest caribbean is best for development clark said if you get a storm in this area in september when the water's warmest it can just explode this is where camille formed and exploded referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the gulf coast it is an exciting thing to watch if you're on the beach watching the storm surge it's a different story he said the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure measured at 2613 inches tuesday night that broke the 2635 inches

caused coastal flooding in puerto rico in the dominican republic all domestic flights and flights to and from puerto rico and miami were canceled forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the dominican republic and haiti as it moved south of hispaniola the caribbean island they share and headed west it's still gaining strength it's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the caribbean for a long time said hal gerrish forecaster at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla at 3 pm edt the center of the hurricane

pay for damage from tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates industry spokesmen and analysts said wednesday only 15 percent to 20 percent of california homeowners have earthquake insurance which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100000 home according to industry spokesmen the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said that in the san francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance the organization estimated residential damages from tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the bay area with between $100 million to $150 million insured insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices said hugh strawn director of catastrophe services at the property loss research bureau in schaumburg ill insurance companies attempted wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay in addition to home damage the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage broken glass theft and burglary business interruption due to electrical outages water damage and possibly workers compensation some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more from the quake but industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims we don't think any company is going to have problems paying claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the american insurance association a washington-based trade group the insurers actually could benefit industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from hurricane hugo which hammered south carolina and other parts of the southeastern united states earlier this month an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term the analysts said there's a perception that this could turn the cycle that this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an analyst with bear stearns & co inc in new york despite their predictions for the long run the analysts warned that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing it's going to be a meaningful loss perhaps as big as hugo said robert glasspiegel an analyst

california where many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred under a 1985 california law insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high industry spokesmen said they estimated that at least 25 percent and probably many more business properties are insured because of its high costs earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial proposition 103 approved by california voters last year the proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback in insurance rates insurers and state regulators are battling over the rates and how they're set

edition metro part b page 6 column 1 editorial writers desk 652 words a special session with speed gov george deukmejian is right to call the legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last tuesday's northern california earthquake with congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible and as soon as is practical deukmejian should be commended as well for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape the governor is wrong however in his campaign to distance himself from the california department of transportation on the issue of what caused the nimitz freeway in oakland to collapse and what could or should have been done to have prevented it while deukmejian is not necessarily blaming caltrans he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as what did you know and when did you know it the governor's answer which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake was that no one in caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake he was shocked that such a thing would happen this has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that california stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase there is keen interest of course in why the freeway collapsed and whether something might have been done the major reason is so that california can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake there has been no widespread outcry against the governor while the department of transportation and the state transportation commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds the governor also sets general state priorities the governor complained on sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake but no one who has lived in california more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake california is on the edge of earthquake-related technology but still does not know everything that needs to be known the state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from tuesday oct 17 but it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality in the bay area that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage but face massive obstacles in getting to work the governor and legislative leaders will meet again next monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session it almost certainly would include a temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the office of emergency services for allocation to local governments but the need could well exceed the present reserve the scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge the governor and legislature should not wait too long to start the session although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to california the legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained editorial

some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action mr bush and his aides were accused of responding too

announced that mr bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 630 am from chief of staff john sununu by noon mr bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster proclamation received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters mr bush himself

highways such as the section of interstate 880 that collapsed in oakland generally don't have insurance coverage industry officials say the bay bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds however the bridge which charges a $1 toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including fireman's fund corp based in novato calif and cigna corp based in philadelphia earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william yankus an analyst with conning & co a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up $325 to $102625 general re corp up $275 to $8650 aetna up $2375 to $5950 and marsh & mclennan inc up $3125 to $75875 still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated i think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said oppenheimer & co analyst myron picoult he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo british west german scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster although it's unclear how much exposure the london market will face uk underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to us catastrophe coverage jack byrne chairman of fireman's fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire orin kramer an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the 1906 san francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of $58 billion he is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo ap890922-0071 ap-nr-09-22-89 0634edt u i britain-blast 3rdld-writethru a0526 09-22 0467 britain-blast

assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks if we designate places as being low-risk categories then it is likely they will be attacked given the way that the ira is forced to operate o'neill

to gourmets it is estimated there are more than 5000 different chinese dishes in canton 125 miles northwest of shenzhen chefs specialize in some of the more exotic chinese dishes such as cat stew bear paws chicken feet and a famed snake dish - dragon and tiger locked in battle - made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat and garnished with 20 spices lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals however many chinese who earn an average $32 a month are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants in shenzhen a chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have

officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for mcdonald's hamburgers opening the second mcdonald's restaurant in moscow along with a 12-storey office block mr george cohon head of mcdonald's canada could well be described as the russian authorities' idea of a model investor mcdonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serve russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for russian gratitude mr viktor khlystun the agriculture minister praised the fact that mcdonald's gets most of its supplies from inside russia after setting up a dollars 45m processing plant outside moscow he also thanked mcdonald's for providing jobs a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry and finally for what he described as 'the most delicious food' but despite the jolly opening ceremony - with big macs musicians playing the balalaika and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant m - life has been tough for mcdonald's since it opened its first restaurant in moscow 3 1/2 years ago although the first moscow restaurant is the busiest mcdonald's in the world the plunging rouble high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to mcdonald's management who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial dollars 50m investment 'it will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants what happens to the rouble what happens to raw materials that we buy we don't have an estimate of how long it will take there are too many variables' said mr cohon apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor the mcdonald's office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate

taste their first beeg mak gamburgers picking them apart to marvel at the fixin's some expressed wonder at the speedy service -- only an hour in line -- while others heralded the event as the first evidence that president mikhail s gorbachev's economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average muscovite although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures the arrival of the fast-food chain here -- 14 years after a canadian mcdonald's official broached the idea with soviet officials at the 1976 montreal olympics -- was without doubt a major event most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it even though some of them gave the big mac sandwich a mixed review it tasted very i would say unusual lubov sereda 45 said with a smile everything was very soft and mild but those strawberry milk cocktails well her husband put in flashing a thumbs-up sign it was very interesting that gamburger zvetlana generotova 25 said leaving with a large paper bag filled with take-out food also a new concept here i certainly want my family to try it at least once russians say gamburger because they pronounce western words that begin with h as though they begin with g another customer victor kunyasev said well my wife makes better food but it was nice a good place to take a break and grab a bite to eat some reported waiting up to 1 hour and 45 minutes to be served but most did not seem to mind in honor of the grand opening a brigade of workers distributed mcdonald's flags and pins entertainers performed on the accordion and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the soviet hammer and sickle the world's largest mcdonald's with 27 cash registers and a seating capacity of 900 brings to moscow not only hamburgers french fries and shakes called milk cocktails here but also a living lesson in western-style marketing at training sessions before opening day cashiers were taught the importance of greeting customers cheerfully of saying please and thank you -- all of which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service at most of moscow's dingy state cafes this is very different from anything i've ever done before cashier larissa lebedeva said lebedeva 25 who formerly worked as deputy director of a small food store said that to be this polite and to have everything this clean is new for the workers as well as for the customers sam yahel from mcdonald's in atlanta who helped train the 630 soviet workers said the soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants most of the soviet workers had never tasted a western-style hamburger they practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and different colored poker chips in place of onions tomatoes and pickles the soviet union is definitely a different world yahel said our food and our standards -- it's all new for example we had to teach our employees that when there were still crumbs on the counter it needed to be wiped off again while most of the soviet workers trained for a matter of days the four soviet managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs they graduated from the canadian institute of hamburgerology the moscow mcdonald's will be open for 12 hours a day beginning at 10 am and will be able they say to serve more than 15000 customers a day on wednesday though it stayed open an extra two hours and served a mcdonald's record 30000 meals the previous record for opening-day transactions was 9100

that has come into the soviet union in recent years accepts only hard currencies meaning that it caters primarily to foreigners the mcdonald's prices are high compared to the state restaurants where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble the big mac costs 375 rubles or about $5 at the official exchange rate and dinner out for the family can come to two days' wages for the average soviet worker mcdonald's employees are paid 150 rubles an hour with a chance for an increase of up to 50 kopecks in three months' time the staff was chosen from 25000 applicants canadian and american officials who have helped train the soviet personnel know that the allure of working for a western firm was a drawing factor but they nonetheless expect a 20% turnover rate twice their normal average mcdonald's invested $50 million in setting up the restaurant and a food processing plant in a moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties to sesame-seed buns soviet farmers who are supplying most of the products have been given special training and disease-resistant seed for potatoes and cucumbers the extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much as 25% of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer despite all of the planning some shortages still affect the operation coffee is not on the menu for example because supplies cannot be guaranteed the joint venture agreement between mcdonald's of canada and the moscow city council calls for 20 restaurants though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second mcdonald's will open is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas of russian orthodox churches it will be a sign that capitalism is making real inroads in the communist capital mcdonald's officials say it is not a question that worries them or their soviet counterparts there weren't many ideological discussions during these negotiations said marc winer 43 a native of nashua nh who is general director of the moscow outlet the soviets understood that the food was going to move very efficiently from the field to the mouth that is more important to them right now than almost

which has asia's fastest-growing economy had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from seoul on terms south korea may be one of mcdonald's most promising foreign markets business analysts say the country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise a middle class hamburger-related fast-food sales in south korea totaled $875 million last year a 30% rise from 1986 according to the ministry of finance analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon the business is likely to profit from the 1988 olympic games in seoul in september and from an anticipated post-olympic economic boom here however the competition is heating up and there is a good possibility that south korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket an official for the south korea chamber of commerce and industry says the competition besides wendy's international's 11 shops and six of burger king a unit of pillsbury co includes home-grown burger chains mcdonald's strategy is to take

rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper more oldfashioned approach a brief advertising campaign in newspapers distribution of fliers and word of mouth mr sifri says the emphasis will be on developing mcdonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in south korea attention will be given to attracting children he adds mr ahn says mcdonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the harvard-trained accountant in 1984 two years later mcdonald's and mr ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form mcahn mcdonald's struggled with the government over mcahn's royalty payments to the us partner -- the issue was resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products the import question came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value mcdonald's said even mcdonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape

announced he wants the 41-year-old indiana senator to be the republican nominee for vice president those who have known the quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life dan and marilyn quayle met as law students in indianapolis married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period one of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit said indianapolis attorney william r neale treasurer of quayle's 1986 re-election campaign he's the same nice guy he was in law school neale who grew up with marilyn tucker quayle in indianapolis introduced dan quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the indiana university law school in the early 1970s dan quayle who grew up in huntington graduated from depauw university a small liberal arts college in greencastle ind before going to work in the indiana attorney general's office in 1970 daniel f evans also a law school classmate of dan quayle said he doesn't expect quayle's national candidacy to change him i think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are even after this said evans who was chairman of quayle's 1986 campaign friends said the quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in washington his family

privacy is going to be the biggest minus said mrs quayle 39 quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if bush offered it tucker was fascinated by the idea quayle said benjamin was ambiguous but he thought secret service agents might be able to help him on tests at school mrs quayle said corinne didn't like the prospect of having

whenever he heard the indiana senator speak i'd say `there stands the next thomas jefferson' and added warner he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather thomas jefferson of virginia former president gerald ford made the comparison with kennedy a democrat in 1960 the american people voted for john f kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as dan quayle said ford john kennedy had been in the house and senate 14 years before he was elected president and dan quayle's had 12 years what quayle thinks of those references isn't known but he doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol robert redford whether indeed he looks like redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder in the parlance of politics it's an issue they are both male they are both blond the so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 senate race and redford took umbrage the actor who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in the candidate sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature quayle said the news media had made the comparison not he and after he was elected sent redford an autographed picture of himself and this week he told reporters he considered the so-called redford look a stigma he wasn't asked how he felt about being painted as another jefferson or kennedy meanwhile fellow senators were trying to publicize quayle who at 41 hasn't had a chance to become a legend he is a republican vice presidential candidate who is not as spiro agnew

reform or the inf treaty dan quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch supporter of the reagan revolution and now he is ready to carry that revolution forward and believe me he is ready and just let the democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign just let them try now i don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience he's got plenty of experience plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools experience in increasing spending year after year after year in massachusetts and i just don't believe the american people want that kind of experience in the white house it sounds like a dukak-eyed idea to me but dan quayle's got experience too he's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all americans and the future of our country that is 12 more years of national experience than michael dukakis _ and he is running for president as i said at the start dan quayle is a man i know and trust i am honored to nominate him for vice president mr chairman and

supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young indiana senator but the dream faded overnight bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the republicans by withdrawing from the ticket though he found himself in danger of fizzling thursday quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a bush administration let's go on to victory quayle exhorted as the crowd erupted in cheers the 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy bush who followed his running mate to the podium said he was proud to have dan quayle at my side the two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through indiana ohio and illinois but beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened quayle's candidacy just as it was launched retired maj gen wendell c phillippi _ who worked for quayle's grandfather eugene c pulliam as managing editor of the indianapolis news _ said he contacted the national guard on behalf of quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended him very highly the news reported quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school a bush aide said the matter was discussed with the indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the guard bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping quayle from the ticket as some republicans suggested quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall it was a daunting change for the senator whose youthful vigor rapid political rise striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of john f kennedy quayle alluded to the national guard issue during his speech saying he was proud of the six years he served he also addressed his relative anonymity many this week have asked `who is dan quayle' the people of indiana know me and now the nation will those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition sen bob dole of kansas who placed quayle's name in nomination stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job he's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator that is 12 more years of national experience than michael dukakis and he is running for president dole said sen alan simpson of wyoming one of those who seconded the nomination said quayle would bring vim vigor and vitality to the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign whether quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen others notably democratic vice presidential nominee

inaccurate i didn't hold that job for two years quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane earlier however quayle spokesman david prosperi called the revelation of the error by the plain dealer of cleveland a cheap shot quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state attorney general's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the indiana national guard quayle a 1969 graduate of depauw university was attending indiana university law school at the time m stanton evans then an editor with the indianapolis news helped arrange his job interview with the state evans worked for eugene c pulliam quayle's grandfather and publisher of the news at no point in any of this did dan quayle ask any favors or use any influence said evans now with the national journalism center in washington dc he wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator he was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits it's a nothing story evans said theodore sendak the attorney general at the time recently had surgery and is unable to comment according to his son timothy sendak patricia gifford a marion superior

resolve complaints over defective products false claims in ads faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud in 1980 quayle referred to himself as a vietnam-era veteran in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent birch bayh in a senate race quayle who enlisted in the indiana national guard dropped the reference after objections by some vietnam combat veterans in that same election which he won quayle said he was on active duty for several periods during his tenure in the guard the statement referred to periods when quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp

press writer washington ap dan quayle is likely to be a man on the outside in george bush's white house following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts say encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies quayle enters a bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe gop areas quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that walter mondale and even bush had some scholars feel dan quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more one thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown with quayle it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals said ryan barilleaux a professor of political science at miami university in oxford ohio who studies the american presidency bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign when asked bush employed the stock lines that quayle would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military service academic record and personal life the president-elect told reporters quayle would have access to the same papers information and intelligence that is available to the president but he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give quayle quayle says bush has talked to him about heading a space council and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts i will be a very close adviser to the president quayle said but that's not the way everyone sees it both bush and mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns barilleaux notes dan quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the bush campaign he doesn't have his own big reputation on capitol hill dan quayle has no friends in a bush white house except george bush barilleaux says they're going to give him a lot of window dressing a space council drug task force but he's going to be a man on the outside not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis except on a pro forma basis but eddie mahe jr a gop consultant who worked with the bush campaign says bush is likely to give quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign vindication demands that both of them will want to prove how right the decision was mahe says democrats portrayed quayle during the campaign as a lightweight a man with little or no legislative accomplishments untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency even some members of quayle's own party were dismayed at bush's choice quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the holocaust and his declaration i didn't live in this century norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute says quayle while not the world's leading intellectual is not a complete dummy he was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared ornstein says i think he's immature he's not stupid ornstein says but quayle comes to the white house with a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate ornstein says that's going to give him a good deal to overcome it's going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself that's going to be difficult given the office both barilleaux and stephen hess of the brookings institution see parallels in quayle's vice presidency and those of richard nixon and spiro agnew the choice of nixon was viewed as a move by dwight eisenhower to appease the party's right wing and agnew was seen as a political nonentity the natural response is to use him quayle sparingly as nixon did with agnew in 1968 hess says however quayle has four years to prove himself and i think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned how much he's acted responsibly how far he's come from the campaign of 1988 quayle admits the campaign was a learning process after the controversies subsided quayle declared his independence from his bush handlers saying he would be his own man he became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from washington and to deliver the party's scripted message soon he dropped off the front pages and although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news he played the role of loyal no 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity we have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all that's what we're supposed to be he told reporters that willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a bush white house mahe feels since bush wants a private adviser whose experience and opinion he respected who has never had another agenda dan quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone mahe says you're never going to see dan quayle telling tales out of school la111289-0035 133531 november 12 1989 sunday home edition view part e page 1 column 4 view desk 879 words roger simon a strategy that bears repeating by roger simon one year after his election dan quayle has achieved all he ever wanted he has become dull his coming-out party last sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news he went on meet the press this was no small thing during his entire campaign for the vice presidency quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows he didn't appear on meet the press or this week with david brinkley or face the nation and he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news his every slip his every gaffe his every goof was news he was the stuff of nightly tv monologues a lot of people feel quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job jay leno once said that joke was not only funny but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency mike dukakis tried to make quayle a major issue and failed but some also felt that quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications so when quayle got to washington he got there with one goal support the president and make himself a very small target stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992 we had asked him on the show a number of times christie basham senior producer of meet the press told me but he always declined we renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show he changed his mind and said he would it was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest and it says something about dan quayle's reputation that he would be considered above and beyond the usual guest normally a vice president would not be that's because vice presidents don't actually do anything they don't run departments or make policy they mostly wait for heads of state to expire as george bush once joked about his duties as vice president you die i fly but quayle was considered a hot tv guest because he might screw up he might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the president none of this happened the show was uneventful quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news some major newspapers didn't even bother to do a story the next day it was everything quayle had hoped for i asked david beckwith his spokesman why quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show well he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job beckwith said he wanted to solidify his relationship with the president and learn the inner workings of the administration so why go on now it seemed like a particularly opportune week beckwith said george bush and mikhail gorbachev had announced a summit central america was back in the news and oh yeah bush had said dan quayle would be on the ticket in 1992 and marlin fitzwater bush's spokesman called and just suggested we do the show beckwith said the selection of dan quayle had been bush's first major and some would say only decision of his presidential campaign he had input from a number of people but quayle was george bush's choice many thought it was a terrible choice but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow and bush's announcement that quayle would be his running mate again was bush's way of saying i didn't screw up the first time i made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was i am making it again and now was the time for quayle to go on meet the press and show everybody just how right george bush had been i asked beckwith if quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone he was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions beckwith said a lot of the time you never know what you're going to get into sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious a typical example of a non-serious question often put to dan quayle is why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you but quayle got no questions like that last week i asked christie basham of meet the press if quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be yes basham said but almost all the guests do quayle's questioners were david broder of the washington post and elizabeth drew of the new yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions if quayle had been told the questioners were going to be hunter thompson and jimmy breslin i have a feeling quayle might have come down with laryngitis after the show fitzwater called quayle to express his and presumably the president's pleasure at how quayle had handled himself quayle had said very little and he had said it very well the very limitations of a vice president's role don't make him an ideal guest beckwith admitted almost by job description a vice president is not permitted to make serious news and quayle knows his future is in sticking to that during the 1988 campaign i interviewed quayle and i came away with one overwhelming impression dan quayle would run for president in 1996 and he will do so i believe by being a vice president who keeps his head down his nose clean and his life dull after all it worked

a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the united states we're preserving history says david schenkel the exhibition coordinator a century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him if so huntington will be ready relatives former classmates and longtime neighbors of quayle have donated yearbooks report cards poems letters his little league uniform

fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and they say least-understood vice president he has taken such a bad rap said schenkel a foundation board member if people knew him they'd see he's a regular person if they had a chance to sit down with dan as a neighbor they would see the extremely good values in the man these are the faithful who have long since stopped expecting good press on their man instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity describing the best coverage as more upbeat or halfway decent they defend the relatively young age of quayle who turned 44 in february all he needs is a little seasoning his limited experience look at what they said about truman -- he was a haberdasher and his passion for golf he has to have some form of relaxation but they are careful not to stretch the superlatives the description nice comes up a lot he's not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is says dottie watson president of the republican women of huntington county he's a very nice person a capable person everybody i know says he can do it that is not to say some people don't have some friendly advice for quayle if he would slow down talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying i don't think people would take him the way they do said jean anne drabenstot the owner of nick's kitchen quayle's favorite restaurant hayden schenkel chairman of the huntington county democratic party and a distant cousin of david schenkel says some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the united states most of the democrats and even some of the republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president and they're 100 percent behind him but in all due respect we sure hope nothing happens to president bush quayle has declined an invitation to attend the tribute citing a busy schedule nonetheless most of huntington's 17000 residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition which tracks his life from infancy through law school from the senate to the vice presidency the free exhibition has turned a gray room in the town's public library into a virtual dan quayle museum the display patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly ordinary there is dan quayle and his brother chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at christmas there is dan quayle with his vacation bible school class dan quayle with the high school golf team dan quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with sharon mceachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the fort wayne country club it is all very 50s very middle american almost surreal in its innocence there are windows into the workings of the quayle family too for example his father james signed the report cards when dan brought home poor grades and his mother signed when he brought home good ones and there are letters and poems that he wrote which only go to show that one does not have to be a yeats to make it in politics dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on nov 22 1960 when he was 13 years old my dad is very very nice but he is not made of sugar and spice sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed but at other times he is as cheerful as a bird the exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper announcement of dan and marilyn quayle's wedding the wooden quayle & quayle shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here and assorted campaign souvenirs including the official air sickness bag from the 1988 republican national convention ultimately the foundation wants to build a repository for the memorabilia it has already organized a walking tour of historic quayle sites like the white ranch-style house where he spent his early days and nick's kitchen where he likes to order tenderloins fries and a milkshake we want everybody to

when a secretary telephoned from wal-mart stores inc's corporate headquarters in bentonville ark chairman sam walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the de soto store paying unexpected calls on stores is one way walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on his example is followed by other wal-mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field says ed nagy district manager for 9 stores in the dallas metropolitan area it's not like `uh-oh someone's coming' because they're always out by all accounts sam walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company everyone from wal-mart president and chief operating officer david glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the gospel according to sam as he is called to paraphrase sam's primary rules of retailing rule no1 is the customer is always right rule no2 says just in case the customer's wrong revert to rule no1 if the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun they are because that's the way sam is people who know him say he shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews he's happy to chat with folks in his stores though he also regularly reminds wal-mart associates that hospitality to customers is crucial he preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores wal-mart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s one of the most sensitive subjects for walton is the fortune he's amassed a close associate says sam would probably give anything not to be named on fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people the magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in wal-mart stock is worth about $68 billion sam walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his bank account says don shinkle wal-mart spokesman samuel moore walton turns 71 on march 29 he was born in kingfisher okla and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker he graduated from the university of missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined jc penney co as a management trainee in des moines iowa after serving three years in the army he went to arkansas and opened a ben franklin five-and-dime store eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee the seeds of the wal-mart empire were sown when sam and his brother james l or bud opened the first

bentonville home and that is special to us walton who prefers bird-hunting tennis and opening new wal-mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires according to forbes magazine's july 24 edition the walton family's estimated worth is $87 billion up from its 1988 estimate of $65 billion he is unavailable said wal-mart spokesman don shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain based in bentonville about 150 miles northwest of little rock shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters monday morning when the forbes list appeared in newspapers shinkle said news coverage about walton usually sets off a press frenzy for comments from him but the 71-year-old businessman declined to comment he feels any attention to sam walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to sam walton the founder of the company shinkle said he very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings it just puts him in a position he doesn't want to be but walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty just after the 1987 stock market crash in which walton's family-owned chunk of wal-mart stock lost millions in value he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper walton then changed the subject walton was first listed by forbes as the nation's richest man in october 1985 three years ago forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people walton made that listing as the richest american every year since this year he ranks third behind two japanese businessmen shinkle said walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at rogers more than two decades ago he is out of the office up to four days a week the spokesman said he spends most of his time talking to associates and customers shinkle said

didn't see a future in it don shinkle wal-mart's director of corporate and public affairs attributed wal-mart's success to its associates _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all wal-mart employees are partners in the company _ and to sam walton's leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time at the start of 1990 wal-mart owned 1402 stores employed

92 / international company news founder most important retailer of his generation by martin dickson sam walton was arguably the most important retailer of his generation the son of an oklahoma real-estate broker he opened the first general store in what was to become the wal-mart chain in bentonville in the backwaters of arkansas in 1950 writes martin dickson by 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly dollars 44bn making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues and the walton family probably america's richest wal-mart now operates in 43 us states selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs the chain's success stemmed both from mr walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy he was a frugal modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff whom he insisted on calling 'associates' he would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction long before these became fashionable management buzz-words employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in us service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the walton philosophy he buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions bonus payments for good performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy eight years ago when wal-mart's profits were better than expected he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on wall street also essential to wal-mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume cut-price retailing throughout the year rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty 'low prices always' became wal-mart's motto mr walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small rural towns of the us south it was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business though in the process wal-mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores prompting bitter resistance in some towns which mr walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations the financial times london page 26 ft923-5068 _an-cieapabtft 920903 ft 03 sep

subject to critical scrutiny so to an extent have the less wholesome adventures of the four walton children but no one has ever been able to make sam himself look bad the worst that has been said is that he was rather dull walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol common-sense and a lot of harmless if charming anecdotes or they will find it dreary and downbeat walton makes no excuses 'i realise this may sound boring to most you' he writes at one stage 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a bedmate ' a few snippets are more revealing about the character there cannot be many billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point meanwhile the competitive energy which sam walton applied to his business is inescapable in one of many contributions from friends and family don soderquist wal-mart's chief operating officer tells of finding sam one saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local kmart store analysing his rival's stock and his wife in a casual aside notes that when the couple was on holiday in italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission but it is david glass wal-mart's current chief executive who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial walton spirit best explaining the annual contest in which wal-mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to promote he recalls the time sam who usually won selected minnow buckets for carrying bait glass was more happily teamed with apple juice 'so i would go down to the stores and get them to take that minnow bucket put ice in it ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket i particularly did it in stores i knew sam was going to visit it drove him crazy and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick ' but the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth sam walton was a salesman to the core and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called moon pies for the most part this makes for an engaging if one-dimensional portrait occasionally it just grates 'i had bought a bank in bentonville for about about dollars 300000' walton remarks for example 'just a little old bank with only about dollars 35m in deposits but it helped me learn a lot about financing things' oh come on sam is that the whole story the real truth one suspects comes right at the end of the book - when walton admits that 'if i hadn't gotten sick i doubt i would have written this book' given the pleadings of publishers - doubleday paid about dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it but these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis at the end of the day sam walton's heritage is in the shopping malls not the bookstores the financial times london page 18 ft944-12170 _an-ekbd9agpft 941102 ft 02 nov 94 / ft review of business books 10 few better qualified - what is most startling about wal-mart is the speed of its growth / sam walton's american dream by neil buckley 'wal-mart a history of sam walton's retail phenomenon' by sandra s vance and roy v scott twayne publishers new york dollars 1495 240 pages many people might be said to be the personification of the american dream few are better qualified for that title than sam walton walton is a character it would be difficult to invent an all-american boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen the church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near kingfisher oklahoma he founded a store chain which made him america's richest man and which shortly before his death in 1992 became the world's biggest retailer his company wal-mart made sales of dollars 55bn last year and after walton's death fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - dollars 235bn what is most startling about wal-mart is the speed of its growth although walton built up a small chain of ben franklin variety store franchises from 1945 it was not until 1962 that he opened his first wal-mart discount store at the time of its incorporation in 1971 wal-mart had only 38 outlets with sales of dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal discount merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest us discount retailers ten years later with 330 stores and dollars 16bn sales it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the us its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of sears roebuck the biggest and 11 per cent of k mart the second-biggest within another 10 years wal-mart had overtaken them both apart from walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death however published material about the company is curiously scarce this book attempts to fill the gap to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of wal-mart setting it in the wider context of us retailing and explaining how it was achieved one strength the authors identify is wal-mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers sam walton did not invent discount retailing rather he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the us's leading discounters of the early 1960s including ann and hope e j korvette spartan's fed-mart and k mart walton learned from them all but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed another strength is wal-mart's openness to technology as early as the 1950s walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life sometimes walton was more reluctant to invest in technology and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system this technology helped wal-mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer but perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success the book suggests has been wal-mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in bentonville arkansas rather than in costly regional offices are despatched every monday by aircraft to their regions spend the week visiting stores working with staff and managers and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every friday they discuss results problems and suggestions from the week at a 730am meeting on saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results district managers hold a conference call with their store managers and before the day is out the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads the system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and if the idea is accepted by the saturday meeting see its implementation begin the following week even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes however one was walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of ronald mayer only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins another was wal-mart's short-lived hypermart format which proved too big even for gigantist america then there was walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on wall street if wal-mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984 it did and he did the book also covers well the debate over whether wal-mart's impact on the economies of small us towns was positive or negative if there are criticisms these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer moreover it makes little attempt to predict whether wal-mart can continue its growth and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the us but this is a

was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern florida and louisiana this week a grade two dollar crisis on a one-to-four scale four being most severe was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for us and world financial markets on wall street most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago friday and on the following monday when bond yields jumped sharply and the dow jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points the flimsy walls erected hastily by the federal reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades the currency dropped to dm140 this was its lowest-ever point against the d-mark the conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time interest rate differentials between us and germany widened over the summer as the fed eased and the bundesbank tightened their respective monetary policies the failure of the us economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar so too was the political hole president bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent moreover the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down while there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling there are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall the first is that it raises import prices and as a result adds to inflationary pressures the second is that it makes it hard for the fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency the first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of us gross domestic product so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower the second explanation carries more weight although there is not much chance given the present economic and political climate that the fed will raise rates to help the dollar there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the fed to ease monetary policy again the fear that the fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets but investors in stocks were equally if not more troubled by the rise in bond yields just over a week ago the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy looked as if it might drop below 73 per cent the dollar put paid to those hopes and by the middle of this week it was approaching 745 per cent putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers the dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week and the devastating effect of hurricane andrew produced a typically hard-eyed although nonetheless logical reaction from wall street the stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern florida the area hit worst by the hurricane all took a tumble but the relatively modest losses in geico travelers and progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims the flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from

reunification again under discussion as changes sweep europe eds also in monday ams report an ap extra by kevin costelloe associated press writer frankfurt west germany ap three decades ago a west german politician said german reunification was a sleeping lioness that would awake one day with a mighty roar now there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate europe reunification is coming closer but i can't say whether it will take 10 15 or 20 years says west german conservative lawmaker eduard lintner we have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago the daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing east german leader erich honecker's hard-line communist rule for the capitalist west has revived international interest in the debate once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream the idea of german reunification has gotten a public nod from president bush and something short of a categorical no from president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union the idea makes east german leaders virtually apopletic if there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the german democratic republic east germany certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the federal republic of germany added the 44-year-old lintner in an associated press interview the west german constitution calls for a united germany but it has not been a paramount concern of the west germans in the years since the ruins of nazi germany were divided into east and west at the end of world war ii full national reunification would completey rework the postwar european order mapped out by the conquering allies it is a prospect that creates unease in britain and france and in poland in the east bloc london's prestigious sunday times on sept 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in europe honecker's death and further westernization of poland and hungary moscow unilaterally abolishes the warsaw pact after guarantees from poland and hungary they will not join other alliances the times' futuristic view continued west germany withdraws from nato and a referendum in both east and west germany votes for reunification and neutrality that sort of talk is being heard more and more as moscow loosens its hold on the east bloc and countries like the soviet union poland and hungary explore democratic reforms the implications of pulling down the berlin wall and other barriers to link the two german states are enormous and for many ominous as much of western europe heads towards its own unification in 1992 the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the german side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _ 611 million west germans and 166 million east germans west germany is already europe's largest exporting nation and despite its many flaws east germany's economy is the envy of many soviet bloc neighbors a unified germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux as democratic movements sweep parts of the soviet bloc older generations recall eerie echoes of nazi dictator adolf hitler's boasting that he had brought about the unity of the german nation eva kulesza head of research for the soviet union and eastern europe at the french institute of international relations says she believes that as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward germany this new fear of germany is linked to german economic trends germany is much stronger much more dynamic than france she added since west germany and east germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from washington and moscow during a news conference last week in montana bush said that reunification is a matter for the germans to decide but he added if that reunification was worked out between the germanys i do not think we should view that as bad for western interests for his part gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in bonn in june saying only the situation in europe today was determined by historical realities outside germany political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue in thinking about the german question we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions wrote commentator peter jenkins in london's the independent the cold war was conducted in the name of freedom and today if the coming of freedom to east germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the federal republic we ought not to be opposed willy brandt the social democrat who sought greater ties to the east as chancellor in the 1970s said german unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a hypothesis that cannot be excluded as talk grows in the west the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in east germany as people leave the country in near-record numbers more than 100000 east germans are expected to resettle in west germany this year leaving a gaping hole in the communist nation's work force little is likely to change in east germany as long as the 77-year-old honecker and his aging comrades stay in power during a september 1987 visit to bonn honecker called respect for europe's present borders a basic condition of peace socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water honecker added on the issue of reunification there are virtually no indications that honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms let alone joining the capitalist west the calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the polish solidarity movement in the country that suffered some of the nazis' most brutal savagery after all the abnormal situation of the german nation overshadows the whole of

of a reunified germany enjoys support from the united states and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic german superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout europe the lifting of travel restrictions by east germany on thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single german state drawing expressions of support from the bush administration and others but soviet affairs expert william hyland says that despite these assertions a reunified germany is really terrifying to most of the countries involved to the west germans to the united states soviet union poland and czechoslovakia no one really wants german unity except the east german people and they turn out to be the decisive factor says hyland a one-time top aide to former secretary of state henry a kissinger it was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of world war ii a time when a unified germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people while a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario an undivided germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent the official us policy on the reunification question was outlined last thursday by state department deputy spokesman richard boucher reunification has been supported by nato and by the united states for 40 years and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of germany must take place in peace and freedom he said as former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski sees it the reunification issue will become very very active if a freely elected government takes power in east germany that possibility has been mentioned by east german leaders as part of the ongoing reform process brzezinski asks how do we arrange for the unification of germany so that it doesn't become destabilizing so it isn't a threat to germany's neighbors _ france poland czechoslovakia these are the issues we really have to very hard think about we have to think of a new structure between nato and the warsaw pact that is our new agenda theodore sorenson a top aide to president john f kennedy when the berlin wall was built in 1961 says he hopes a reunited germany will be forged as part of a reunited europe reunification sorenson says will pose problems because we couldn't afford to have a reunited germany outside the western alliance the soviet union couldn't afford to have a reunited germany as part of the western alliance that's why i hope it will be a reunited europe within which the reunited germany can take place sorenson says bernard rogers a former commander of allied forces in europe does not think reunification is inevitable some form of federation he believes is more likely rogers notes that soviet president mikhail gorbachev has said the nations of eastern europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the warsaw pact if east germany stays in the warsaw pact nato with the best of its ability would try to prevent full reunification maybe a confederation between the two germanys but not a full reunification rogers says senate majority leader george mitchell d-maine points out that german reunification is a sensitive question for the soviets soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified economically strong and certainly militarily strong germany mitchell says there must be some serious apprehension in the soviet union today because the events of the last couple of days certainly has made reunification more likely the bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of nato under any circumstances but according to hyland the reunification of germany could mean the demise of the alliance it may also mean the end of western european unity because both have been based on a divided germany and a divided europe hyland says if that comes to an end and 80 million germans are united in a confederation or a single state it changes the entire map of europe it changes all of the geopolitics and in effect ends the period we've been in since

a reported surge in anti-polish sentiment in east germany in recent weeks has heightened polish anxieties skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on poland's current borders skubiszewski faulted west german chancellor helmut kohl's program for gradual german reunification offered last week for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between poland and east germany some right-wing west german politicians have called for recovering the 40000 square miles of territory that germany lost to poland at the end of world war ii the territory is about one-third of present-day poland east germany and west germany each separately has recognized the border but there has been no official assurance that a reunified germany would also acknowledge the border one can only unite within established borders and without territorial arguments said skubiszewski he also said german

restructuring relations between the two germanys must involve all directly interested governments asked by an east german correspondent about his attitude toward reunification gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it however the english-language tass translation indicated gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification itself gorbachev's position was similar to that adopted by communists in east berlin on tuesday for the first time the communists acknowledged german unity as a long-term goal but said it must be imbedded in the process of overcoming europe's overall divisions the soviet union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of german reunification but gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in eastern europe soviets say the question of german reunification is to be decided in the future gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting french president francois mitterrand in kiev in december reiterated his view that the existence of two german states is a fact based on the outcome of world war ii but he added the present situation is the result of specific historical events a specific historical process on this continent so history should decide the future of this continent i don't think it is a topical question today a different approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire european process including the relations between the two german states gorbachev said modrow said the two germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit he said he agreed with gorbachev that reunification must be decided not only by east and west germany but all of europe according to tass the

germany no fear of jackboots but worries nonetheless by mike feinsilber associated press writer washington ap historians say the world need not fear that german jackboots will echo again on european pavements but some still see the rush toward german reunification as a setback _ a step away from the integration of europe for the most part the historians say an east germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united german state the west germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor but a perceived need to deal with a crisis said henry ashby turner of yale author of the two germanies since 1945 there is no such a thing as indelible national character turner said i don't think there is any chance that the young men of germany are going to slip out of their adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying `heil he was one of several experts in german history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision tuesday by the four world war ii allies _ the united states britain france and the soviet union _ to accept the reunification of a germany they divided 45 years ago university of chicago historian michael geyer a native of germany said he feared the creation of a strong sovereign nation in the center of europe could reverse a more important development _ the 40-year drive toward an integrated europe in which industries banks trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders the east german state is collapsing said geyer so something has to happen very dramatically but they have a choice _ the europeans and germans and americans do they want to opt for the european card or for the german card i think they are opting for the german card i hear these days very little about what gorbachev called `the house of europe' he said the result of a dominant uncomfortably strong german state geyer added could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders it could also mean he said that american troops might have to stay in europe as a counterweight to germany if i had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992 after the integration of the west german economy into the economy of western europe said charles j herber of george washington university expressing similar concern then there would have been fewer chances for german adventurers he said west germans were aware of their european neighbors' misgivings said richard breitman of american university and so they presented reunification within the context of european integration they wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united germany again dominating europe even if the history did not exist there would be fears of that kind he said we're dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories for all that breitman said one germany is not only inevitable but given the successful record of west germany over the last 40 years my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos the only alternative to reunification added turner is an east germany in ruins a basket case a bangladesh of europe he said germans have no significant interest in territorial revisions those misgivings are misplaced gerhard weinberg of the university of north carolina considered a leading historian of the nazi era cautioned that reunification if mishandled could prove explosive while the people of west europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts east europeans living in closed societies have not he said and fear of germany is a reality in east europe and russia he said i don't think the germans are heading for moscow again but we have to give people _ and the germans have to give people _ time to think this through and get used to it mishandled reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end gordon craig emeritus professor at stanford said the division of germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which worked pretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected german reunification said craig gives the world the chance to build a new international system one that will prevent the use of international violence he added we have to be careful that we don't fall back

where they decided on the `final solution' is the right place to have such a meeting and the anniversary of the victory in europe seems to be the right day some 100 members of the world jewish congress from about 70 countries will attend the conference at the villa in wannsee berlin where on jan 20 1942 high german government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the jews jews have a right to state a moral position on german reunification and we will make a moral statement and part of that moral statement is to see that it the holocaust doesn't happen again bronfman said in the long run he said a united germany can be a very positive thing for europe but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history for example germany's borders must be sealed in cement and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons he said bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-semitism once the two germanys are united in fact he said reunification might cause a decline in anti-jewish feelings now that reunification is about to be a fact they won't be blaming the jews for a divided germany bronfman explained the conference will convene may 6 and a formal declaration on german reunification will be issued may 8 it will be the first meeting ever held on german soil by the world jewish congress which was founded in 1936 in response to hitler's

be free of party political interference not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national regional or global interests whatever policy the kohl government followed over reunification it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in germany as the western german population is now aware german reunification needs a strong growing west german economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher german inflation than the bundesbank would wish in europe as a whole very high real interest rates threaten to turn recession into depression the governments of europe have been remarkably patient with the bundesbank although it is threatening nearly 10 years of european effort for greater economic and political integration surely there must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter it is ironic that just when german reunification presented a short-term reason for germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities accommodating european convergence bundesbank intransigence is threatening the emu commitment beyond europe the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary but germany is the one economy which for reasons of reunification could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front yet mr otmar issing the bundesbank's chief economist advises there are no grounds for a cut in germany's interest rates this despite the unreliability of german money supply data the german government might point out to the bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed in germany of the destruction of the emu programme and global depression a dm exchange rate adjustment within the erm is not the answer to the problems we need a prolonged low-interest-rate german reunification boom the european currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of bundesbank interest rate policies and this is aggravating recession a future european-wide central bank must clearly - like the us federal reserve - be more accountable in the broader european political and economic interest the governments and central banks of europe and the g7 block - including the kohl administration - should

for german reunification kohl says by william tuohy times staff writer bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl declared on his return from moscow on sunday that the way is now free for german reunification his meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev convinced him he told west german radio that the two german states should enter into negotiations as quickly as possible after the march 18 east german election kohl will meet with east german prime minister hans modrow on tuesday and wednesday in bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation including monetary union to prevent the collapse of the faltering east german economy political and economic union go hand in hand kohl said he said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to stop the hemorrhage of east germans to the federal republic and keep them in their heimat or home in east germany kohl said that his talks with gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an economic breakthrough in east germany which in turn could provide a push forward for all of europe asked how soon the two germanys could merge kohl declared that the march election has to come first and then i think it will all go very quickly the chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in east germany now support reunification and after the election he said they will want to put their programs into practice quickly gorbachev inquired about plans by west german politicians to campaign in east germany kohl said adding that the soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity west germany's social democratic party is expected to campaign heavily in east germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls major members of the party including former chancellor willy brandt are scheduled to appear at rallies on behalf of the east german social democrats with the surge of the east german social democrats political analysts are pointing to the strange role they could play in the ultimate political fate of kohl ever since reunification became a blazing issue kohl's standing in west german opinion polls has risen and if the national elections now scheduled for december were held today he would have a good chance of leading his christian democratic union to victory but if the two germanys are fused before the west germany election in december the growing number of social democratic voters in what today is east germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in december -- could easily tip the balance away from the christian democrats pushing kohl out of the government leadership kohl helmut reunification

of disaffected east germans has rekindled reunification talk in west germany where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two germanys no one is predicting a date for a possible reunification proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of east bloc reform trends and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to washington and moscow yet growing signs of ferment in east germany have given chancellor helmut kohl's government reason to consider the possibilities eduard lintner parliamentary speaker on german affairs for the joint christian democrat and christrian socialist caucus in the bundestag said his committee has placed reunification on its october agenda he said the sessions which will include government officials and outside experts hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with west germany's western allies particularly the us it has become clear to the world that the communist system in east germany is in trouble mr lintner said the time has come for us to show our allies but also reform-minded people in the east that german reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about there are still a number of imponderables mr linter conceded for instance we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic the us ambassador to bonn vernon a walters earlier this month reaffirmed washington's policy of supporting a german reunification based on free democratic elections but mr walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future emerging opposition to uncompromising communist rule in east germany has raised questions on how long east berlin's leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring east bloc countries reforms in poland hungary and even the soviet union have magnified east germany's stalinist controls fledgling protest groups and the influential protestant church have begun pressing for reforms in east germany which if allowed to include free elections could eventually lead to a reunited germany according to some western experts dorothee wilms bonn's cabinet minister for inter-german affairs said in an interview in the newspaper welt am sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all west germans favor a reunifed germany the desire for reunification a feeling of togetherness a sense of nationhood -- all this has strongly increased in recent years ms wilms told the newspaper the recent escape movement from the ddr makes especially clear that people of both german states want to live free amongst themselves she said but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight the first step she added is the reform process in the ddr most west german governments since 1949 have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of west germany's constitution political realities have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult further many west german

egon krenz the successor and former politburo member guenter schabowski on wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end there was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces krenz told an investigating commission in east berlin the testimony was broadcast on east german television schabowski said honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early october working closely with his then-secret police chief erich mielke honecker took things into his own hands schabowski said all decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through honecker and mielke like krenz schabowski denied any personal responsibility for the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital the attempts at suppression were engineered by honecker and mielke bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling politburo krenz insisted then-general secretary erich honecker and the internal security chief erich mielke immediately

authorities was neither politically nor morally justifiable he told the panel speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit krenz who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding honecker on oct 18 insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators numerous news media accounts have said honecker either planned or issued such orders krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years from today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society said krenz an influential politburo member even before honecker's fall krenz added that he and other then-members of the politburo failed to realize that the roman catholic and lutheran churches were not working against but rather for the german democratic republic honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic perspectives krenz said of his one-time patron who for

owner anthony attalla is suing the other two john and rita remondi charging that they have been showing cory even though he is officially retired as announced in dog news in the suit filed in federal district court in manhattan mr attalla says cory has achieved the pinnacle of success and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished mr attalla claims that his work with cory is no gravy train in the suit he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- cory so far mr attalla says he's spent over $125000 the amount sought in damages in return he is entitled to all ribbons and awards the remondis are in charge of caring for the dog despite the retirement the suit says the remondis showed cory twice recently he placed fourth and then didn't place at all for now a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows in a memo filed in court mr remondi claims that mr attalla retired the dog simply and solely to better the chances that mr attalla's agent would win with a rival rover the remondis also say mr attalla has bought a rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both cory and the other dog they claim that mr attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses stud fees are also at issue the remondis argue

man of his art was 72 the longtime leader of the ny philharmonic carved a niche in history with 'west side story' by myrna oliver times staff writer leonard bernstein the renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist composer conductor and teacher and was as well the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus died sunday in his manhattan apartment he was 72 bernstein known and beloved by the world as lenny died at 615 pm in the presence of his son alexander and physician kevin m cahill who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure on cahill's advice the conductor had announced tuesday that he would retire cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left bernstein too weak to continue working in recent months bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency his last conducting appearance was at tanglewood mass on aug 19 bernstein was the first american-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra often joining his new york philharmonic in playing his own pieces while conducting from the piano he etched other niches in history by composing the indelible west side story and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series omnibus exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life with it he became a personality well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show the dervish persona including his upstart gymnastics on the podium never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight he made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses and he lifted popular music to a higher plane infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound some conductors mellow with age commented times music critic martin bernheimer when bernstein conducted the los angeles philharmonic at ucla in 1986 but bernstein at 68 remains a frenetic

stabbing hunching bumping grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized showmanship masked lazy sloppy or inept musicianship bernstein could never have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades he knew what he was doing and the musicians he accompanied wrote for conducted or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own louis bernstein so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted was born aug 25 1918 in lawrence mass to two russian jewish immigrants his father samuel joseph bernstein was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a talmudic scholar his mother jennie resnick bernstein who survives him said her son always had an ear for music when he was 4 or 5 he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill the parents preferred the name leonard and called the boy that when his kindergarten teacher asked louis bernstein to stand up he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name bernstein changed his name legally at age 16 when he got his first driver's license his mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident when bernstein was 10 a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it he asked for lessons and soon was playing better than his teacher a neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson by age 12 he was studying at the new england conservatory of music and had determined despite his father's objections that music -- at that point playing the piano -- would be his career bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading remembering complicated scores and improvisation became evident as he played and altered classical jazz and popular music he produced his own shows and versions of the mikado and carmen and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the state symphony orchestra he reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old boston latin school at harvard university bernstein studied piano and composition but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting american composer aaron copland a fan and practitioner of his music bernstein met copland in a typical it-could-only-happen-to-lenny incident invited to a dance recital in new york bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize invited afterward to a post-recital birthday party for copland bernstein commandeered the piano and played copland's piano variations his performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony who of course was copland they became lifelong friends copland introduced bernstein to several composers and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher boosey and hawkes ironically copland subsequently urged the torn bernstein to make conducting rather than composing or even piano playing his career conducting emerged as a possibility to bernstein that same year -- 1937 his sophomore year at harvard -- when he met the greek conductor dimitri mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus mitropoulos was so impressed with bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the boston symphony the maestro also talked with bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts promising to keep in touch the influence of mitropoulos on my life on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all bernstein wrote years later after his mentors had all died because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom i studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess i have namely serge koussevitzky and fritz reiner but long before i met either of them i had met dimitri mitropoulos and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the boston symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which i wasn't even aware of until many years later graduated from harvard and out of work after a summer in new york bernstein asked mitropoulos what he should do you must be a conductor mitropoulos replied urging him to study at juilliard or with reiner at curtis institute in philadelphia it was fall and conducting classes at juilliard were full so bernstein went to philadelphia for two years during the summers he studied under koussevitzky conductor of the boston symphony at the new school koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home tanglewood he became like a surrogate father to me bernstein later said of koussevitzky his third major conducting mentor he had no children of his own and i had a father whom i loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all and so i found another father first mitropoulos then reiner and now koussevitzky but the koussevitzky relationship was very special very warm bernstein later became koussevitzky's assistant and returned to tanglewood annually to conduct and teach he so revered the maestro that he was married in koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links it was koussevitzky -- and fate -- who arranged bernstein's meteoric ascension to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25 on his 25th birthday aug 25 1943 bernstein was told by the koussevitzkys that he should visit artur rodzinsky newly appointed music director of the new york philharmonic at his stockbridge conn farm i am going to need an assistant conductor rodzinsky told him i have gone through all the conductors i know of in my mind and i finally asked god whom i shall take and god said 'take bernstein' he said granting the position as a favor not to god but to koussevitzky remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an american and so young bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium in the orchestra's history no assistant conductor had ever been called on but for lucky lenny history made an exception on nov 14 less than three months after bernstein got the job guest conductor bruno walter fell ill and rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm jennie tourel had sung bernstein's i hate music at her town hall debut the previous night in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town and he had played for her and the post-recital party with no rehearsal a hangover and three hours sleep bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on cbs radio the new york times chronicled the epic event on page one and stated in an editorial mr bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity it's a good american success story the warm friendly triumph of it filled carnegie hall and spread over the airwaves bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the new york philharmonic in 1957-58 he had no time for one he was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor successful as a pianist composer and conductor bernstein according to joan peyser in a controversial biography consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits it is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities bernstein wrote in 1946 what seems right for me at any given moment is what i must do the ends are music itself and the means are my private problem the piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career his first major composition a symphony titled jeremiah was introduced in 1942 and his first ballet fancy free and related first musical on the town both debuted in 1944 he sought to be a classical composer winning plaudits for symphonies jeremiah was followed by the age of anxiety in 1949 and kaddish in 1963 sonatas and the operas trouble in tahiti in 1953 and a quiet place in 1983 in writing music bernstein achieved greater success on broadway and even in hollywood than in lincoln center he followed on the town with the musicals wonderful town in 1953 the score for the film on the waterfront in 1954 and the critically acclaimed but less popular candide in 1956 his best and best-remembered work west side story debuted in 1957 if i can write one real moving american opera that any american can understand and one that is notwithstanding a serious musical work i shall be a happy man bernstein said in 1948 when many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with west side story he disagreed saying there are moments when i think so but as a sum total it fails to be an opera because at the denouement at the dramatic unraveling the music stops but i don't love it any less he added reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the romeo and juliet conflict had produced it doesn't make it a stepchild or a foundling in teaching his fourth area of expertise bernstein taught regularly at tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his charles eliot norton lectures on tonality at harvard in 1973 it was on television in the 1950s and 1960s with his young people's concerts of the philharmonic and omnibus that bernstein taught the nation an assessment of bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music a role that has set him apart most from other performers conductor historian and bard college president leon botstein wrote in harper's in 1983 instinctively adept at television bernstein became a prototype for carl sagan alistair cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the public broadcasting system bernstein's programs botstein said displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score its complexity or its simple genius no one before or since bernstein has been so effective -- artistically and commercially -- in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience the television classics won bernstein a coveted peabody award bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling new york philharmonic he introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance he left the orchestra in 1969 after a record 11-year tenure at the helm to have more time for composing and guest conducting if two rings of the bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life known for his emotional embraces of both sexes bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his manhattan apartment or connecticut country home a heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people god knows i should be dead by now he said as he approached 70 characteristically cavalier about his health i smoke i drink i stay up all night i'm overcommitted on all fronts i was told that if i didn't stop smoking i'd be dead at 35 well i beat the rap raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the vietnam war in the 1970s criticized for radical chic his leftist political philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the black panthers in 1970 in 1989 he rejected a national medal of the arts in protest of the withdrawn $10000 grant later reinstated of the national endowment for the arts to an art show on aids although peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that bernstein had many homosexual affairs bernstein promised his children never to read the book there was no question that he adored his family on sept 9 1951 he married chilean actress felicia montealegre and despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in 1976 remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978 bernstein is also survived by two daughters jamie and nina as well as his sister shirley and brother burton spokeswoman margaret carson said the funeral would be private staunchly opposed to retiring until last tuesday bernstein continued his guest conducting composing and recording perhaps topping his more than 200 records with the best of

in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the mount st helens explosion a us government scientist said monday i think we could see a major explosive eruption any time said peter lipman a volcanologist at the us geological survey office in menlo park lipman is in daily contact with five usgs scientists in the philippines who have been studying the volcano since april when it first stirred front huge eruption likely in philippines 'any time' a huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11500 feet above the volcano today spreading ash over a six-mile radius the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said if it does erupt the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining clark air base he said also in peril are the 350000 residents of angeles city where the air base is located about 50 miles north of manila even if the volcano does not erupt the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least lipman said scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan he said the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano the researchers along with 10 filipino scientists and their equipment today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base 12 miles from the volcano where they should be safe from ash avalanches mount pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the ring of fire on the pacific coasts of asia and the americas these volcanoes -- including mount lassen in shasta county and mount rainier and mount st helens in washington all in the cascade range -- arise where one of the earth's immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another pinatubo's last eruption 600 years ago is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as mount st helens did when it erupted in 1980 until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring it had not been studied well other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were el chichon in mexico in 1983 and nevado del ruiz in colombia in 1985 if it does have a massive eruption pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1000 degrees or more flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph engulfing and searing all in their path in the worst case a really big eruption all of clark air force base could be covered with glowing ash lipman said just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal that is what killed 38 people in japan last week such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base lipman said planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit so far the winds have blown ash away from the base but winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern expected to begin any day would send ash directly toward the base the volcano's activity -- measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system -- is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent lipman said the scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes to watch it swell as magma builds inside on clear days they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions their predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in japan which is of comparable size no reputable scientist i know of is drawing a connection between the two lipman said more than 500

handled the privacy questions very well without taking a stand on abortion i don't see how you could ask him to do anything more thomas expanded earlier testimony by saying wednesday that he believed the right of marital privacy was fundamental -- a status that accords it the fullest judicial protection from government intrusion but he repeatedly refused to state his views on the 1973 abortion decision based on women's right of privacy to give such an answer he said would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case thomas who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles that moved committee chairman joseph biden d-del to give thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could help me understand them during future questioning thomas testifying calmly but warily did offer fuller comment on another hot

past speeches or articles he told the committee my view is that i have been consistent thomas' opponents believe republicans strom thurmond of south carolina orrin hatch of utah charles grassley of iowa alan simpson of wyoming and hank brown of colorado are solid thomas backers but they hope sens edward m kennedy d-mass and howard metzenbaum d-ohio will be joined by the three swing-vote senators

biden said that's not the question i asked you judge republicans tried to deflect criticism over thomas' refusal to answer questions from the democrats it is in my view inappropriate to keep this up said sen orrin hatch r-utah he said thomas had been asked more than 70 questions about his abortion views even though justice david h souter was asked only 36 such questions during his confirmation hearings last year what are we going to have sixty-four-thousand questions on abortion before we're done with this approach hatch asked enough is enough thomas said senate confirmation of his nomination would give him an opportunity to serve and give back and to bring something different to the court i can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the court does thomas said several senators were openly skeptical wednesday over thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 supreme court decision legalizing abortion if that's so said sen paul simon d-ill he's the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion kohl added i'm concerned about his candor his willingness to be forthcoming today kohl asked the nominee is it fair of you to say to us for the most part just view me on what i'm saying here this week kohl asked the black federal judge whether he was offended by published comments calling his appointment by president bush a quota that would trouble anyone thomas said adding i don't think it's accurate he said bush assured him he was picked because he was the best qualified of those potential nominees considered thomas is expected to continue testifying through friday the committee next week will hear from other witnesses two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- howell heflin d-ala and arlen specter r-pa -- also voiced concern about thomas' answers but the panel's traditional third swing vote dennis deconcini d-ariz said thomas was doing well thomas' opponents believe republicans strom thurmond of south carolina hatch charles grassley of iowa alan simpson of wyoming and hank brown of colorado are solid thomas backers but they hope sens edward m kennedy d-mass and howard metzenbaum d-ohio will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and biden patrick leahy of vermont simon and kohl in voting against the nominee thomas' views excerpts from clarence thomas' testimony on abortion i have no reason or agenda to prejudge the issue or a predilection to rule one way or another on the issue of abortion on affirmative action the line that i drew was a line that said that we shouldn't have preferences or goals or timetables or quotas on natural law at no time did i feel nor do i feel now that natural law is anything more than the background to our constitution hear it see it senate confirmation hearings for

ends bush nominee appears headed for high court the committee will continue to hear testimony for and against thomas at least through the end of the week but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote that the senate confirm thomas regardless of the outcome thomas said on his way out of the hearing i have been treated fairly before thomas' testimony ended the unflappable 43-year-old federal judge was criticized sometimes in harsh terms by several liberal democrats they accused him of being evasive and of disavowing many controversial statements he made while an official of the reagan and bush administrations thomas repeatedly explained that he made the speeches as an advocate for administration policy acknowledging that they often contained overheated rhetoric sen howard metzenbaum d-ohio said he found it difficult to accept the notion that the moment you put on a judge's robe all the views and positions which you held prior to going on the bench just magically disappear i want to look into the window of your soul patrick leahy d-vt said to thomas but i find the shade down quite a bit sen edward kennedy d-mass delivered a long stinging lecture to thomas declaring the vanishing views of judge thomas have become a major issue in these hearings kennedy listed 10 instances in which he said thomas had abandoned or contradicted his previous positions kennedy told thomas he had walked away from his record on the right to privacy refused to comment on its application to abortion and asked lawmakers to believe that an intelligent and outspoken person like yourself has never discussed roe vs wade the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling with another human being moderate republican arlen specter of pennsylvania who often casts a swing vote on the committee said he was not troubled by thomas' shift toward more moderate views at the hearings i believe he's going to be a surprising justice i don't think you can pigeonhole this man specter said if thomas is confirmed as expected he made it clear that for the first time in decades there would be not one justice on the supreme court who is convinced that capital punishment is unconstitutionally cruel justice thurgood marshall whom thomas would replace was the last member of the court who opposed the death penalty in all cases thomas told the judiciary committee that philosophically there is nothing that would bother me personally about upholding it the death penalty in appropriate cases after thomas left the hearing room an american bar association evaluation committee told the senators that his articles in law journals were deficient in presentation content scholarship and analysis but those limitations were

boston ap new treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before perhaps even three days after their attacks a study published today concludes doctors from the university of michigan medical center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early they found that these people had no unusual complications got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills it was an extraordinarily safe strategy said dr eric j topol the study's director there were no problems with any serious events topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator or tpa and angioplasty when given quickly after a heart attack tpa can dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons the report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays however the study in the new england journal of medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted in the 1950s doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack when president dwight d eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955 he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital however doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good patients got out of shape developed blood clots and became demoralized in the 1960s the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks now doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days in their paper the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge none of them had irregular heart beats chest pain or heart failure treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage forty patients were sent home after three days while the rest stayed seven to 10 days after six months of followup none had died and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar however people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $12546 versus $17868 the researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days the annual saving would be at least $280 million in an accompanying editorial dr gregory d curfman a deputy editor of the journal cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays this single study he wrote is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks ap880818-0088 ap-nr-08-18-88 0901edt r a pm-heartdrug 08-18 0533 pm-heart drug0548 heart attack drug not always helpful researcher says by randolph picht associated press writer rochester ny ap a drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients according to a study published in today's edition of the new england journal of medicine surprisingly however the study found that the drug diltiazem increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally experts said even so the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug which is now primarily used to treat angina doctors said the drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the united states and canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack said dr arthur moss a clinical professor of medicine at the university of rochester and the principal investigator for the study the results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients moss said but the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack we now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to moss said that's what this study was all about diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker the newest class of drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease nitrates and beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors the study involved 2466 heart attack patients who were given either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo patients were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months overall the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 percent which was not statistically significant moss said but in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump function _ 1909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _ diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent moss said in patients whose hearts had pumping problems the drug not only didn't help but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent dr john schroeder a cardiologist and professor at stanford university said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher but the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective schroeder said i think it will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on a long-term basis dr george beller a cardiologist and professor at the university of virginia said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion this is one of the first reports that seems to identify that he said diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade beller said and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages nitrates have been used for more than 50 years and beta blockers were developed in the 1960s ap880829-0222 ap-nr-08-29-88 0905edt a a

percent for a few weeks earlier this year not because of a rash of headaches a study of more than 22000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half the study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them in the most recent report doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack without the treatment patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks the researchers found with the treatment the figure dropped to 8 percent the real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce in-hospital mortality substantially says richard peto of oxford university one of the study's authors heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death by far the national center for health statistics reports that 762820 americans died of heart disease in 1987 to put it another way of the 2127000 american who died that year more than one in three died of heart disease this does not include those who died of blood-vessel diseases such as strokes the drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby aspirin the usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood the blockage arises from the buildup of fats cholesterol and clotted blood clot-dissolvers break up clots thus restoring blood flow aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process helping to prevent clot formation in the first place the limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the united states show that many doctors are still not using them despite their proven success but that is beginning to change some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital we have to know how to respond quickly and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis says dr burton sobel of washington university in st louis a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers the most important thing we can do is teach patients in advance about the value of early treatment he says while most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks researchers at the university of michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days the patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group after six months not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group the researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days in july stanford university doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks all of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk early next year the american heart association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk us surgeon general c everett koop in july issued his first report on nutrition calling on americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables fruits fish poultry and whole grains the report has been likened to the first surgeon generals report on smoking issued in 1964 which focused public attention on smoking's hazards koop's recommendations largely echo those of the american heart association but they should help carry the message to many more people progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against much can be done to prevent heart attacks great improvements are being made in treatments and recovery is faster than ever before the use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could alone save 25000 lives a year in the united states doctors say these results says dr peter sleight of oxford university will change medical practice worldwide ap881115-0113 ap-nr-11-15-88 1338est u w am-heart-balloon bjt 11-15 0657 am-heart-balloon bjt640 study says emergency heart procedure unnecessary after heart attacks by daniel q haney ap science writer washington ap the expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary and should be abandoned according to a major study released tuesday the study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure known as angioplasty some experts said the results are good news because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available the study also has an important financial message its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million this trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology commented dr j ward kennedy of the university of washington seattle the study is phase 2 of the thrombolysis in miocardial infarction trial or timi-ii directed by dr eugene braunwald of brigham and women's hospital in boston the first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator or tpa immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival the latest study presented at the annual meeting of the american heart association was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving tpa at 50 hospitals across the united states doctors randomly assigned 1636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open a comparison group of 1626 also got tpa but they were not considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or abnormal exercise tests during their recovery after 42 days 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks as did 10 percent of those in the comparison group a year after the treatment there was no difference in survival about 93 percent of both groups were still alive there does not appear to be any additional benefit from angioplasty braunwald said dr thomas j ryan of boston university medical center commented we have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery while small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed if the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure the watch word is watchful waiting to see if patients need angioplasty this ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed said dr howard morgan immediate past president of the heart association heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle the purpose of tpa and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies to be effective the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs in others the treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery or a history of strokes balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks the latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty ap890115-0014 ap-nr-01-15-89 1239est r a am-heart bjt 01-15 0652 am-heart bjt0672 heart disease death rate drops dramatically but still biggest killer eds for release at 5 pm est

every 32 seconds the american heart association said sunday the good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population said dr bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic foundation who is president of the heart association those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing she said the bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million americans a year and we've got a long way to go the association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits including fewer cigarettes and better food and improved medical treatment the public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years said dr myron l weisfeldt of johns hopkins university it's almost unbelievable there is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment however weisfeldt who is president-elect of the heart association also cautioned that much work remains both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health i believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the united states by the year 2000 if we stop smoking get cholesterol treated if it's above 220 and identify and treat hypertension he said ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed the heart it underlies most heart attacks the single most lethal heart ailment association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978500 americans died from heart attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels cancer the no 2 killer took 466000 lives between 1976 and 1986 the death rate from all forms of cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent it declined 28 percent for heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes the association's figures show that more than one in four americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease and almost half of those eventually die from it about 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks during this period there is still time to give them drugs to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks this treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart attacks other major goals he said include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest the heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost $882 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages among other statistics released by the association _the most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure which affects 60 million americans _about 200000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each year occur in people under age 65 _there were 1418 heart transplants in 1987 almost nine times as many as in 1983 _about 25

death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks according to a major study released thursday the study conducted in denmark found that the drug verapamil known as a calcium channel blocker was effective for the 1{ years after a heart attack calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure this is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction or heart attack said dr carl j pepine of the university of florida several other studies of calcium blockers including one large us study published last year failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks according to the danish study verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks while calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment we feel it is important to have alternatives many patients do not tolerate beta blockers said dr kresten mellemgaard of central county hospital in hillerod denmark a co-author of the study beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with asthma and emphysema this means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers who are frequent victims of heart attacks in the study conducted at 20 community hospitals doctors compared 897 patients who got verapamil after heart attacks with 878 people who took placebos after 18 months of followup there were 146 deaths or recurring heart attacks among the verapamil patients compared with 180 in people who got the dummy medication we wanted to see if an effect would be observed with verapamil said dr forgen fischer hansen of copenhagen municipal hospital if it had an effect it should be seen in the first 12 to 18 months because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period he said then it levels off that's what we demonstrated it worked the researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work needed by the heart to sustain circulation calcium blockers lowered the chances of ischemia episodes in which the heart's own muscle is deprived of oxygen they said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks however they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking beta blockers and this might have obscured any benefits from calcium blockers the results were presented at a meeting of the american college of cardiology among other research described at the meeting _dr james h chesebro of the mayo clinic said a five-year study found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing blockages in the arteries feeding the heart although it may modestly protect against the development of new deposits however like other studies this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks _dr eugene braunwald of harvard medical school said the next phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina this is a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work or stress until now the drugs have been used only to treat heart attacks ap900705-0149

substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack according to a study published in the journal science in a study at the jefferson medical college in philadelphia a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the tgf beta tgf beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack said dr allan m lefer a professor at jefferson lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts in 12 of the rats the researchers injected a placebo in the other 12 they injected transforming growth factor beta for those who received the tgf beta said lefer the damage from the attack was much less severe there was about 50 percent less injury with tgf beta than without it the extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted as in a heart attack tend to lose creatine kinase said lefer thus by measuring for the loss of this substance researchers could determine the amount of heart damage lefer said the tgf beta seems to block the action of other substances such as tumor necrosis factor that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack tgf beta is normally present in heart cells but the study published in science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack though tgf beta is produced naturally in the body lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by genentech a california biotechnology firm lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with tgf beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away jefferson medical college where the study was done is part of thomas jefferson university in

pm-cholesterol0460 study cholesterol-lowering surgery saves lives by daniel q haney ap science writer boston ap an intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease researchers said today the surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant drawback it causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years in the operation doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed this reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream the $52 million 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks the approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage during an average of 10 years of follow up the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent in a comparison group without the intestinal surgery it was 39 percent dr henry buchwald of the university of minnesota who directed the study said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment it has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack buchwald said it is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy including this to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack besides diarrhea those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones gallstones and intestinal obstructions the study was conducted in minneapolis los angeles philadelphia and little rock ark and published in today's new england journal of medicine despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question it offers the strongest justification for marked lipid cholesterol ineervention that has ever been offered buchwald said it is a very powerful study and should except for certain people who will never be satisfied end the cholesterol controversy in the study 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone at the start of the study their average cholesterol levels were 251 the surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent the overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts the surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries wsj880603-0129 fda urges caution on the use of aspirin against heart attack pha fda chicago ap doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value the food and drug administration said taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances of dying of other things especially hemorrhagic strokes the agency said in a commentary in today's journal of the american medical association the fda persuaded aspirin makers in march to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks at least for now a study published in january indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal first heart attacks 47% in 11000 male doctors over five years compared with 11000 who took a non-aspirin substitute aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply but aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems or for those who have high blood pressure which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes the fda commentary said strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding the fda commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study compared with two such strokes among 11000 subjects taking the substitute overall death rates for the two groups were the same though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower there were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group physicians will for a time be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information said the fda commentary co-written by agency director dr frank e young we agree with them completely said dr julie buring a harvard university researcher who participated in the aspirin study she added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way and researchers expect to report to the fda in late fall the commentary noted a british study also released in january of 5000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks and that it was associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes wsj910418-0105 910418-0105 health test identifies patients at risk of heart attack ---- by jerry e bishop staff reporter of the wall street journal 04/18/91 wall street journal j page b1 bmy mrk consumer non-cyclical ncy technology tec drug manufacturers drg medical and biotechnology genetic research prosthetics mtc new jersey nj new york ny new york -- an experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack the experiment suggests that doctors could test their patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure to determine how intensively they should be treated to prevent heart attacks researchers said the experiment indicated that the test can spot those patients with extremely low risk of heart attack as well as those with a high risk the experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin might suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks about half of the 15 million americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol levels cigarette smoking obesity and high blood pressure it is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks the blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk said john h laragh of the cardiovascular center at cornell university and new york hospital in our hands it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost the patient $40 to $80 he said dr laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test which was developed by his wife biochemist jean e sealey the test which isn't patented is available in kit form to laboratories the blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is the release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure the urine portion of the test tells how much salt is in the bloodstream a high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure the test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises tending to boost blood pressure the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt the new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by dr laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack the theory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost 20 years the cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood such high renin people are at a high risk of a heart attack on the other hand in other patients with high blood pressure the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood these low renin people are at a low risk of heart attack dr laragh has maintained in the experiment blood and urine samples were obtained at new york city offices and factories from 1717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure the patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by michael h alderman and his colleagues at albert einstein college of medicine who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions in 1981 dr laragh's group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by dr alderman's team they kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks the results published in this week's new england journal of medicine lend strong support to dr laragh's theory only 12% of the patients had high renin profiles but the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients 13 heart attacks per 1000 person-years of observation the incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile -- 53 heart attacks per 1000 person-years -- and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile 33 per 1000 person-years drs alderman laragh and their respective colleagues reported regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles but the real dynamite is in the patients who didn't have any of the usual risk factors dr laragh said in an interview among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction {heart attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles the researchers wrote there were no heart attacks among the 240 patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure to dr laragh this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure we think everybody should have this simple and accurate test he said in the interview it's a new window into heart disease in an accompanying editorial victor j dzau of stanford university medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is potentially useful in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack but he wrote a larger population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper the experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients apparently by coincidence abbott laboratories announced on tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors the experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks a big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs including bristol-myers squibb corp's capoten and merck & co's vasotec are known as ace inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin studies are under way to see if these ace inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure ap891106-0072 ap-nr-11-06-89 1050est r i pm-britain-politics 11-06 0624 pm-britain-politics0643 thatcher says she'll step down after next election by leslie shepherd associated

and political observers said a pro-thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the obvious and that her statements were no cause for astonishment mrs thatcher told the sunday correspondent in an interview published sunday that she hoped to lead her conservative party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth i think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch she told the newspaper the sunday times of london said in a commentary mrs thatcher has committed a colossal blunder she has given the riders for the tory succession their starting orders years in advance of the actual race the newspaper said the next election must be held by the summer of 1992 but it is expected mrs thatcher will call it in 1991 mrs thatcher who turned 64 last month has never previously made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader she was elected in 1979 the first female prime minister in europe and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987 when she said she planned to go on and on earlier this year mrs thatcher overtook liberal lord asquith's 1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become britain's longest continuously serving prime minister of the 20th century mrs thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in britain 50 years ago and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief nigel lawson lord callaghan former labor prime minister whom mrs thatcher defeated in 1979 said her comments had considerably weakened her position if her party wins the next election it is expected mrs thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her successor to choose a time to call a new election my guess is that the tory party will want someone as leader who could take them through the next parliament callaghan said if mrs thatcher resigns while in office her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of queen elizabeth ii but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible the sunday times speculated she would step down by 1994 mrs thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and her husband denis will be 79 and his age may have been a factor in her decision the newspaper said the newspaper predicted the opposition labor party will try to promote leader neil kinnock as the occupant-in-waiting of 10 downing st who is ready able and willing to complete a full term kinnock called mrs thatcher's comments the interview of someone preparing herself for quitting mentally margaret thatcher is preparing herself for packing her bags in an editorial today the pro-thatcher daily telegraph said mrs thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she would not seek a fifth term even were she not to fight a fifth election mrs thatcher could yet enjoy seven more years in charge it said by then she would be in her 70s and her devoted husband a decade older nonetheless what other politician would be expected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions in seven years time and can it really be a cause for astonishment that mrs thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political activity in her mid-70s and beyond ap901122-0100

government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979 here's a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred britain the thatcher era in british politics is almost over it is more likely than not that she is finished altogether the coup de grace may not be delivered at this moment the nature of the era that comes afterward is far from clear but as a political force she is condemned at best to an unrelenting rear-guard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss the party may sullenly support her now but they will ask the question again in the spring knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same question even more pitilessly when the general election comes an alternative however stares her in the face it is to acknowledge that an era has passed and preserve its achievements by standing down releasing her lieutenants and urging her party in the interests of a vanished unity to support mr foreign minister douglas hurd -- thatcher biographer hugo young in the guardian the contest for the leadership of the conservative party should not be occurring it would be foolish to deny that today the prime minister is politically beleaguered as never before but the task of the conservative party in the year and more that remains before the next general election must be to rally to enable mrs thatcher to rebuild her personal position and give her the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves -- the daily telegraph who could have guessed from watching the prime minister answer questions in the commons that she was fighting for her life she was as brisk and well-briefed as ever bloodied margaret thatcher may be bowed she most certainly is not -- daily mail british conservative mps must be prepared to reject mrs thatcher when they vote in the party's leadership election it is no longer in the interests of the united kingdom which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united europe for her to remain in office the european derives no satisfaction from reaching this conclusion apart from her domestic achievements in reviving the british economy in the 1980s mrs thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the european community than she is often given credit for but the european believes that her nightmare vision of europe of ill-intentioned people trying to destroy democracy is not shared by most of the british people they reject her view that pooling of sovereignty is no different from surrender the conservative party faces a stark choice either it will reelect mrs thatcher and see the united kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind the rest of the community or it can choose a new leader who is prepared to participate genuinely in the argument about economic and political union -- the european a prime minister in total command for 11 years could not be unseated and cherished policies abandoned without an explosion within the party it would take a solomon to heal the divisions and prevent civil war frankly we cannot see mr heseltine in that role the sun also deeply questions his ability to be a successful or even adequate prime minister this is the man who for the past five years has professed loyalty to the government and yet has been its most divisive force we discern just one constant loyalty -- and that is to michael heseltine -- the sun mrs thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning manner some tory mps are minded to have in store for her to be defeated by the people in a general election as was winston churchill in 1945 that was an honorable rejection to be brought down by a vote of censure in the house of commons as was neville chamberlain in 1940 -- even that was a constitutionally respectable form of political demise but what they are proposing to do to mrs thatcher unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century is quite simply unworthy her fate could be sealed if her opponents have their way behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms persons of quality were always accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad rather than the humiliation of hanging these plotters would like to dispatch mrs thatcher who almost single-handedly has won three elections by the political equivalent of the rope you can find heseltines wherever you go but there is only one mrs thatcher handle with care this valuable object is irreplaceable -- the sunday telegraph this newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general election would be for margaret thatcher to lead the tories to a fourth victory sadly the course of events has conspired to make that unlikely the british have never liked margaret thatcher but as long as she delivered the goods they respected her and voted for her when her government fails as it has recently that lack of affection turns to growing resentment for reasons that are probably unfair and undeserved mrs thatcher is now a victim of that strongest public mood of all time for a change mrs thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track record and prestige can be so easily challenged if she goes the manner of her ousting will leave much to be desired no other party could so lightly dispose of its leader in government this side of an election largely for reasons of unpopularity but the tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any other party in the democratic world and politics is an unforgiving business the issue before tory mps is not the reelection of margaret thatcher it is the defeat of opposition labor party leader neil kinnock that requires saying a

likely to be immediately recalled while its achievements are left to history to salute thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the european community her government is deeply identified with high interest rates inflation and a flat tax on every adult in place of the property tax that is generally regarded as hugely unfair ultimately in the cold calculus of politics the question that will most decisively sway conservative mps is whether they are more likely to win the next election with thatcher at their head or someone else next week will bring the answer editorial la112390-0008 312054 november 23 1990 friday home edition metro part b page 5 column 4 op-ed desk 857 words the romance is over the anglo partnership pales thatcher she was a symbiotic ally to reagan and then bush she simply lost her own party's allegiance by peter stothard peter stothard is the us editor based in washington of the times of london president bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the persian gulf on thanksgiving day he heard the news of margaret thatcher's resignation as he celebrated the holiday in the saudi desert -- and it clearly came as a shock in the state department too it came as a shock americans who had come to take thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for her passing thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on tuesday the feeling everywhere was that thatcher always stuck to her word so no problem pass the turkey thatcher's friends all over the world had reckoned without the british conservative party which had looked at the opinion polls the bad economic news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election they had reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant michael heseltine among the middle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects if the unpredictable tarzan came to power it was an extraordinary scene in the palace of westminster on wednesday night as one by one her own cabinet members trooped sheepishly into thatcher's office and told her in their chosen code that they couldn't support her over the weekend in the second round of secret balloting on the party's leadership therefore if heseltine was to be beaten it had to be by someone else after sleeping on it as one of her closest advisers put it thatcher reluctantly concluded that she had to go thus did the toughest fighter for shared british and american values since winston churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the conservative party since the failed war leader neville chamberlain when george bush recovered from his thanksgiving surprise he was generous in his praise two years ago his words would have rung hollow the president began his term in office without much trust in her he had seen the influence she exerted over ronald reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man he had heard her doubts over the pace of german reunification and the integration of europe and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the united states' best interests gradually however that changed at the beginning of the persian gulf crisis the president deliberately sought thatcher's analysis it was her assessment of the threat to international security posed by iraqi aggression that according to british and american sources set the moral framework for operation desert shield the pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about iraq on bush's behalf in the colorado mountain garden of the us ambassador to britain henry catto that marked the public turning point she was able to articulate what bush sensed was right and he was able to defer to her without embarrassment seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential successors heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator but it hard to see that helping the tongue-tied american president douglas hurd the urbane foreign secretary is an english james baker the president already has a james baker john major the chancellor of the exchequer and thatcher's own choice to succeed her may have views very close to bush's but he is mild-mannered slightly clumsy and although widely liked and admired by his friends is almost wholly without international experience the issue is no longer the anglo-american special relationship it is margaret thatcher and ronald reagan who will go down in history as washington and london's last romantics they were the ones who would each ditch their closest friends in order to support the other reagan when overruling jeane kirkpatrick's objections to the falklands campaign and thatcher when blocking her own right wing's protests at the us bombing of libya from british bases they shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back -- and she helped persuade him that mikhail gorbachev was a man who could be trusted the powerful enunciation of that belief -- and its eventual vindication -- may be the last great achievement of the special postwar anglo-american alliance george bush and margaret thatcher had something more simple in common a pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both british policy toward iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister the doubling of the size of the british gulf force on thursday attempted emphatically to prove that but as time goes by britain's allies will find that many certainties have passed along with margaret thatcher if seductive deals emerge to save the face and the atomic-weapon factories of saddam

press writer pasadena calif ap the major earthquake that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in northern california a 1988 report by the us geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 65 magnitude on the richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the southern santa cruz mountains the high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906 said clarence allen professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena this is not to say we predicted the earthquake it just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area allen said he noted that the 1988 report titled probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault presented information that was already widely known among scientists allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps frank baldwin of us geological survey's earthquake center said the quake's magnitude was 69 on the richter scale it was centered in the santa cruz calif area 75 miles south of san francico the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs a reading of 6 can cause severe damage a quake of 7 magnitude a major earthquake is capable of widespread heavy damage initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesday's quake especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings it's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event it's something we should therefore be ready for allen said the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 whittier quake in the los angeles area which registered a 59 richter reading allen said i think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake he said what will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the los angeles region in addition some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the bay bridge in some areas of southern california there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring the highest the usgs says is in the central california town of parkfield where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018 ap891018-0084 ap-nr-10-18-89

1906 earthquake devastated san francisco many scientists have believed the next big one would strike the los angeles end of the mighty san andreas fault but studies in recent years have reminded the bay area that it also faced another seismic disaster and those studies became a reality tuesday when a quake measuring 69 on the richter scale rocked the bay area a 1985 paper in the geophysical research letters predicted a 69-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the san andreas fault that stretches 50 miles from palo alto southward through the santa cruz mountains and on to san juan bautista the quake was centered on the san andreas segment described in the article but tom heaton the scientist in charge of the us geological survey office in pasadena said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment the epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of santa cruz and 75 miles south of san francisco the 1985 study by columbia university geology professor christopher scholz was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened tuesday these studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the earth was released by the great san francisco earthquake of 1906 which had a magnitude of about 83 and killed at least 2500 people the bigger a quake the more stress it relieves and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as much stress in the santa cruz mountains as other scientists believed that suggested a bigger quake might happen in the san francisco bay area sooner than some believed others disagreed faced with conflicting estimates the geological survey issued a july 1988 report that it said represented a consensus on the debate the report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years it said the southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of generating a magnitude-65 quake within 30 years tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles of the fault segment clearly scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one heaton said there was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake the last great southern california quake in 1857 killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated thus most assumed that los angeles not the bay area would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe the 1988 usgs report cast doubt on this assumption federal emergency officials have estimated that the next big one _ a quake like the 1906 san francisco quake _ could kill 3000 to 14000 people in southern california and 3000 to 11000 people in the bay area as bad as tuesday's quake was it was not a 1906 earthquake geological survey director dalas peck said the question is not whether a big

site as likely to be jolted by kenneth reich times staff writer tuesday's earthquake the strongest on the san andreas fault since the san francisco quake on april 18 1906 came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in northern california within the next 30 years the epicenter of the temblor eight miles east-northeast of the city of santa cruz in the santa cruz mountains was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on june 27 1988 and aug 8 1989 a 65-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865 the us geological survey in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in california said there was a 30% chance of another 65-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018 the report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the san andreas near parkfield in central california and coachella in southern california in the same period but it pinpointed the santa cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in northern california in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake a period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go and during this time scientists said tuesday night pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the san andreas which had not slipped as much thomas heaton the geological survey scientist in charge of the agency's pasadena field office said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as preshocks of the tuesday's 69 temblor he said foreshocks would not be the proper term since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely but he joined caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 59 magnitude should be expected and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months a 59 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 whittier quake in the los angeles area after both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the santa cruz mountains the state office of emergency services and the us geological survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes ranging up to 65 magnitude within the next few days in the vicinity but these warnings said that if nothing happened then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity the trouble was the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the bay area on the san andreas fault only the nearby hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the bay area the san andreas the longest and best-known earthquake fault in california extends from point arena in mendocino county to the salton sea it has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded history although tuesday's quake was powerful waverly person chief of the national earthquake information service in golden colo cautioned that at 69 magnitude it should be considered only a strong shock not a major one as a quake in the 70 to 79 range would be classified or a great one as a quake of 80 or above would be person and others in the geological survey warned tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than tuesday's will strike in southern california sometime in the next three decades but as it was tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the devastating sylmar-san fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 whittier quake each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the power of an earthquake person said that like most san andreas earthquakes this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another but he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the geological survey's menlo park office jim dewey a research geophysicist at the national earthquake center said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter person said that the area of strongest shaking was around santa cruz although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake the nearest metropolitan area to tuesday's earthquake san jose has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years but several of them have been on the calaveras fault which generally runs just east of san jose more than 10 miles east of san andreas at this point scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the calaveras fault may have been a precursor or somehow added pressure on the san andreas but when a 51 earthquake did strike on the calaveras in 1988 some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case between the late 1950s and 1979 there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger near the bay area but in august 1979 a 64-magnitude quake struck under coyote lake east of gilroy and south of san jose and since then there have been a number of quakes in august geological survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 5-magnitude quakes south of the bay area they noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the san francisco quake of 1906 meanwhile a new mexico scientist who studies tidal forces supported by two eyewitnesses said tuesday night that at a private lecture in san francisco on oct 10 he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about oct 16 iben browning of sandia park n m said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the earth he said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he

buildings collapse at the marina while in nearby chinatown shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained little damage in the 69 temblor why did high-rises that form the elegant san francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart killing five pedestrians below the buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things very poor soil and very poor structural design said peter i yanev chairman of eqe engineering inc a structural engineering firm in san francisco they were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city explained yanev who said he has traveled to all the major earthquakes in the last 20 years studying their impact on construction the soil beneath the marina district where six buildings burned down or collapsed is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 years ago yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early part of this century when there were no earthquake codes what collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom floor yanev said so you have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments you effectively have no walls on one side of the building the connections just break and the front end falls into the street yanev called the two conditions a disaster waiting to happen should we have an earthquake centered off the golden gate bridge instead of santa cruz you'd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse he said experts said they did not anticipate that the marina district would be the major problem in an earthquake the worst areas they believed would be chinatown and the tenderloin where brick buildings abound chinatown survived relatively intact yanev said because it is located up in the hills atop very firm soil and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away in the city's high-rise office towers a few broken windows and other cosmetic damage could be seen a preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers rendered unsafe by the quake but most buildings including the landmark transamerica pyramid were not touched jay cahill an owner of cahill construction co a contractor that built several high-rises in the city said the earthquake codes did their job what this quake proves is that the engineers were right when they said tall buildings could withstand a strong quake he said they said the downtown buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least 8 magnitude with an epicenter in san francisco earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed an earthquake means that the ground shakes and that means force is applied to the sides of buildings said george c lee acting director of the national center for earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo when architects design skyscrapers lee said they factor in wind gusts and earth movement -- forces that are not considered as much when constructing smaller buildings in smaller buildings he said contractors usually make sure that vertical forces -- such as snow and ice -- cannot force a structure to collapse throughout the bay area residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others much like san francisco was left to wonder why the marina district was hard hit and others spared in santa cruz initial damages were estimated at $350 million and 30% of the downtown mall -- the heart of the city -- was severely damaged an estimated 20 commercial buildings must be razed a county official said in los gatos 30 miles northeast of santa cruz portions of the downtown area were destroyed several dozen victorian homes were shifted off their foundations and numerous chimneys crumbled san francisco fire officials said as many as 60 buildings in the marina district may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by the earthquake some of the buildings are extremely hazardous assistant fire chief frank blackburn said they are four-story buildings above garages all they had were vertical columns holding up the structures if you picture a building sitting on columns with no lateral support on those columns when you get sideways motion the buildings slide left and right blackburn said many residents are not going to be able to get their belongings out if a big aftershock comes it'll collapse he said buildings collapsed like cakes without yeast one fourth-floor

them together in time's ledger by larry green and bob secter times staff writers san francisco although they are a continent apart the cities of charleston sc and san francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time they are the scenes of two of the century's costliest back-to-back natural disasters hurricane hugo and the bay area earthquake there are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth from the standpoint of compassion of all the people in america we can feel the hurt that the san francisco area is going through the most charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said sunday one month after hugo hit we know it means at best the disruption of normal life for some time and at worst the loss of life charleston had warning san francisco did not unlike earthquakes hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee still at least 28 deaths in the carolinas are blamed on hugo while at least 60 deaths have been attributed to the bay area earthquake hugo 500 miles across with winds topping 175 mph left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage five days after the storm many city residents remained inconvenienced most without electricity many without safe drinking water street lights didn't work broken glass and other debris left the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires by contrast the streets in most of san francisco were passable within a day of the earthquake electricity was largely restored overnight and most broken natural gas lines were quickly repaired restaurants in chinatown north beach and along fillmore street were crowded saturday night cable cars began carrying passengers sunday and the curtain went up on the opera their streets were immediately passable said charleston police chief ruben greenberg we were gridlocked for two days because of the debris and a week after the hurricane charleston -- which like san francisco has a tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs it was more than 10 days before restaurants and other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin to return tour buses return by sunday tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near fisherman's wharf and at other locations favored by visitors tourism is a $25-billion-a-year business in san francisco it took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on their feet in charleston it's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest industries citywide charleston had 68 buildings collapse compared to 60 buildings destroyed just in san francisco's marina district in charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed it was visible in san francisco much of the damage may still be undetected water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months structural damage to houses in many instances will become apparent over a long period of time when a hurricane is over it's over greenberg said not so with an earthquake you have aftershocks charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure we lost no major economic area like the bay bridge said greenberg who was once san francisco's undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to help the santa cruz police that's an economic lifeline all we lost was one minor bridge they're going to have humongous traffic problems hugo left charleston isolated from the world communications broke down soon after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before the nation began to learn of the widespread damage even local residents were left without any information the hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations and local officials for almost two days depended on a florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings millions were watching the pregame world series program when the earthquake struck and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster san francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered radios and tvs damage estimates from hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion while earthquake damage estimates sunday reached the $66 billion mark besides that black page in the ledger of history both san francisco and charleston also have another experience in common both have experienced frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government greenberg who has now watched the federal government respond to two of america's worst disasters said he sees relatively few differences between how the federal emergency management agency worked in south carolina and northern california there's nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them he said they just plop along like one of the horses at disneyland just plop plop plop they are repeating the mistakes of south

won academy awards for their individual achievements such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of hollywood's highest prize oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences the latest casualties are directors james l brooks whose movie broadcast news was nominated though he wasn't and spielberg who was left out in the cold with his empire of the sun although broadcast news won seven major nominations including best picture and three acting categories brooks was strangely overlooked by the academy's directing branch since no movie has ever won a best picture oscar without its director at least being nominated the chances of the once-favored broadcast news to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on april 11 have been significantly reduced brooks did better in 1984 when his terms of endearment took the lion's share of oscars including best picture and director spielberg's empire of the sun won six nominations this year none of them major and none for director two years ago the color purple received 11 nominations but not for him as director the directors guild nevertheless named him best director that year i'm floored by this spielberg said upon receiving his dga award this is the last thing i expected to happen if some of you are making a statement _ thank god _ i thank you for that why the spielberg slight some observers cite the fact that only 257 directors nominate for the academy awards and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history jaws et raiders of the lost ark the academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting spielberg with the irving thalberg award for consistently high quality of production there was no mention of the fact that spielberg is primarily a director not a producer the thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who were overlooked for individual awards the recipients have included cecil b demille stanley kramer alfred hitchcock ingmar bergman and mervyn leroy the honorary award

on why he failed to win an oscar i suppose it was a matter of carelessness the overlooking of classic films and the industry's most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute

with the flood of oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _ academy members are acknowledging that some oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules secretaries spouses and friends several academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition it's like a local election of judges said academy member harry clein who said he's witnessed team voting a lot of people don't know who the candidates are so they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is as far as elections go it's not bad but i've never been through an election in argentina dan lyle who oversees the oscar balloting for the accounting firm price waterhouse inc said that there is no guarantee that academy members have actually filled out their own ballots all we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned he said members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves more than 4600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st annual academy awards which will be telecast on march 29 from the shrine auditorium in los angeles academy members vote on their area of specialty the academy's actors branch for example is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number lyle said ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied he said nominations for acting directing art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of academy members all voting members of the academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories winners for best documentary feature best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees academy constituent julian blaustein said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously i don't even vote in a category if i'm not familiar with the pictures in that category and i've never told someone to vote for a film even when i've done some of them meanwhile other oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken speculates veteran academy member millard kaufman although you're asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures i think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank he said given the tremendous impact both an oscar nomination and an oscar victory have on a film's fortunes it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the oscars the last emperor took in $189 million close to half the film's gross after it won last year's best picture trophy more than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture platoon came after the film was nominated on average a best picture award is worth about $20 million these days a $500000 oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio therefore can be a good investment in the case of this year's awards a flurry of academy-oriented newspaper advertisements banquets complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful this year all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in december the accidental tourist dangerous liaisons rain man and working girl were all released after dec 16 while these five movies might be good the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios' mastery of oscar marketing i think the academy awards are crap said terry gilliam director of brazil and the current the adventures of baron munchausen it's about selling films is all it's about he said it's one more way of flogging some films when `brazil' got nominated in 1986 they asked me to be a member of the academy and i wouldn't join i just don't want to be a part of that at all and at least one prominent academy member director carl reiner says that the manipulation of oscar voters has reached new depths reiner said that universal studios' all-out effort to bag votes for sigourney weaver a best actress nominee for gorillas in the mist could lead him to vote against the film i have in my house more color reproductions of sigourney weaver and a

isn't tarnished by hollywood hucksterism if you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you risk having your trademark become public domain said bruce davis the academy's executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter but despite the academy's crusade against crass commercialism this year's awards

includes millions around the world it seemed like a good marketing opportunity said coca-cola spokesman ira gleser the academy approached our local bottler in los angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people but even as the academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the oscar name when mgm-ua the distributor of rain man published newspaper advertisements touting the film's oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced the academy issued a harsh statement condemning mgm-ua's promotional gamble after the ads appeared rain man collected nine nominations we regard this as a serious matter and we have communicated our concern said richard kahn president of the academy for nearly 50 years the academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners it also has envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon so auctioning the oscar has greatly distressed the academy the collector's book store local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions has sold off seven oscars in the past year including the best picture trophy for 1951's an american in paris $15760 marlon brando's best actor prize for 1954's on the waterfront $13000 and the black and white interior decoration oscar for 1941's how green was my valley $17715 none were sold by the original recipients heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block when malcolm willits the book store's owner announced that he would hold a february auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for around the world in 80 days the academy said enough initiating a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales the academy insists that a contract signed by oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the academy for a nominal fee but now that the word is out that these awards are worth $10000 to $50000 people are reluctant to sell them back to the academy for $10 willits said the academy has created something of great value here this is the most famous award in the world _ the most instantly recognizable award the nobel prize might be a greater honor but people know more about what an academy award looks like and they're very limited too there's not too many of them around twenty years

protection a federal judge has ruled the small academy award statue is part of the public domain us district court judge laughlin waters said in a ruling released thursday the decision was a setback for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which had sued a chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the oscar academy president karl malden said the ruling comes as a shock to me the academy said it would appeal the academy claimed that the star award the trophy look-alike made by creative house promotions violated copyright laws diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition the star award depicted a naked muscular male much like the oscar just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword it had a gold finish similar to the oscar and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base although waters acknowledged that the creative house trophy is very similar to the oscar he rejected all of the academy's legal claims saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to jan 1 1978 the effective date of the copyright act of 1976 the film industry's top award was distributed from the first ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicating a copyright the judge ruled too that the oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry and therefore did not have a limited purpose as required by the copyright act the academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the oscar and the academy award names and symbols are unaffected we are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades malden said in a statement ap900220-0065 ap-nr-02-20-90 1033est r a pm-people-spikelee 02-20 0218 pm-people-spike

rain man its director barry levinson hoffman and the screenwriters the two of several who worked on it may have fulfilled their roles as favorites but there were no sure things elsewhere and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form the final score shows rain man with four oscars and dangerous liaisons and who framed roger rabbit with three each but there were seven other films with one award each whether the spread represents a change in voting habits or an absence of a film to rally around it made for a great show and in some cases the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process that who framed roger rabbit won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 film sure to be regarded as a classic the good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films that were not box-office hits the voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful thus rain man and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned this year several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers at the box office jodie foster as best actress from the accused geena davis as best supporting actress from the accidental tourist more surprising were the awards given to bird and the milagro beanfield war films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives both films were flawed but the sound editing done for bird which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won david grusin's oscar for scoring the milagro beanfield war overcame even bigger odds winning over popular john williams' score for the accidental tourist the selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had and whether the spread is a quirk one can hope it suggests a trend the 1988 slate of films was on total a marked improvement over recent years the industry is still adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding audience -- and that means a wider variety of films nominees this year represented as wide a range of material as any in years and they produced more winning films the events last night played hell with the office pool but it made for a better show maybe it's the start of something new photo barry levinson a triumph for rain man randy leffingwell / los angeles times photo geena davis takes an oscar home

sues over use of snow white at oscars by nina j easton times staff writer who would have thought that snow white of all people would become the source of oscar night's only major glitch the walt disney co filed suit in los angeles federal court thursday against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences charging copyright infringement of its snow white character and unfair competition the famous fairy tale character portrayed by singer-dancer eileen bowman opened wednesday night's academy awards ceremonies with an elaborate 10-minute song-and-dance routine but disney contends that the character was used on the show without the company's permission we have great respect for the academy and for all that it does frank wells disney's president and chief operating officer said thursday in a prepared statement we were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evening's academy awards ceremonies to see that our snow white character had been used extensively without our permission wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character which debuted in a 1937 full-length cartoon film if such a statement had been agreed to by the academy wells said we would have considered the matter ended for its own reasons however the academy unfortunately did not accede to our request disney spokesman erwin okun did not provide any details of thursday's negotiations with academy officials over an apology except to say that the academy's offer was not to our satisfaction bruce davis the academy's executive administrator declined comment saying top officials needed time to assess the suit we haven't gotten any official notification of this davis said adding that he learned of the legal action from a reporter ironically the academy is extremely protective of the oscar name and statuette copyrights and is quick to object to the image's unauthorized use number kept secret alan carr who produced the oscar show had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until wednesday night's abc telecast but in its suit disney says a company representative learned of the plans early in the week the company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until wednesday afternoon at that point the disney statement said the academy through a legal representative denied to disney that the academy award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of disney without revealing the academy's intention to feature disney's snow white carr could not be reached for comment thursday the snow white character -- as portrayed wednesday night by bowman -- was created by steve silver who for 15 years has used the character in the san francisco musical revue beach blanket babylon disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters particularly in consumer products we sue all the time okun said but okun said the company which won four oscars wednesday night has never sued silver over his use of the snow white character in that production the spokesman however did not preclude the possibility of a future lawsuit we look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company okun explained photo eileen bowman portraying snow white works crowd below photo and dances with rob

zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at gilbert's center at 2613 inches at 552 pm edt on tuesday gilbert was barreling toward mexico's yucatan peninsula that's the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere zimmer said the previous record low pressure of 2635 inches was set by the 1935 labor day hurricane that struck the florida keys with winds above 150 mph killing 408 people he said with tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center gilbert also was one of the largest but because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course no records are kept on their overall size said center meterologist jesse moore hurricane debby which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking mexico last month was probably about half that size moore said gilbert is one of only three category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records the others were the 1935 labor day hurricane and hurricane camille which bulldozed the mississippi coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969 leaving $14 billion in damage and 256 dead a 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in us history however that storm hit galveston texas sept 8 and killed more than 6000 people category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph barometric pressure of less than 2717 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet the storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities camille's storm surge was 25 feet high but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for gilbert zimmer said the damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _ shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane zimmer said the engine itself is this tall chimney of warm moist air in the center if the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels 10-12 miles high then you can have a severe hurricane category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 2717 to 2790 the weakest hurricanes category 1 cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 2894 or more

received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts in an interview wednesday evening pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts he said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back however the judge noted that the attorneys are hopeful all the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further the jurors are deciding whether raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned mcmartin pre-school in manhattan beach the jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case have agreed on 52 verdicts they have all been sealed none of the verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by the jury jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations buckey and his mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one shared count of conspiracy one of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier wednesday after conferring with lawyers pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons however he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts some of them naming only one defendant a split verdict he said would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge it was at that point he said that some jurors began shaking their heads in confusion buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing five women teachers who worked at the mcmartin pre-school had charges against them dismissed among those were buckey's sister peggy ann and his grandmother virginia mcmartin who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school on tuesday deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill on wednesday the talks did not begin until 1 pm because another juror's child was ill no alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial ap900118-0183 ap-nr-01-18-90 2219est r a

ap thursday's acquittals in the mcmartin pre-school molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype mother-and-son defendants peggy mcmartin buckey 63 and raymond buckey 31 wept as the verdicts were announced jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial i just said `i told you ray' mrs buckey said asked if her son was surprised she said he had fear definitely buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer if it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you too if it had not been in my faith in god i wouldn't be here today she said but several parents of former students at the school said the buckeys won because the system lost it was never done properly said parent alan lagunoff who moved to central california from suburban manhattan beach i have to sit back and figure out what to do with my son i fear that because of this verdict no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on his son now 10 attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the trial i don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts it will just be another six-year travesty lagunoff said the system is not going to protect children said jackie mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case i don't know what the message is that the jury wanted to get out i'm anxious to hear that charles buckey father of raymond and husband of mrs buckey suggested deputy district attorney lael rubin who prosecuted the case for its entire six years was motivated by personal ambition my concern primarily was lael rubin who is `anything goes' in order to secure a conviction if you don't win you don't get promoted he said juror brenda williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges even if you accept that the children were molested it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin pre-school ms williams told reporters raymond buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool some observers accused then-district attorney robert philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against ira reiner who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office philibosian however insisted he would not have handled the matter differently ira reiner has had that case for five years and i am not going to take any public criticism directed at me let him respond to the criticism said philibosian now in private law practice also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group children's institute international to conduct the original interviews with the children defense attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers were leading and prejudicial jurors agreed we never got the children's stories in their own words said juror john breese children's institute officials didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment originally there were seven defendants including raymond buckey's sister peggy ann buckey and virginia mcmartin the founder of the school mother of mrs buckey and grandmother of raymond buckey hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and satanic rituals the focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants after reviewing the case the underground tunnels were never found no proof was ever produced of satanic rituals reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long expensive prosecution it took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice we need reform reiner said adding that in trying to describe the case insane is the word that comes to mind the case was the longest and the costliest in american judicial history at 2{ years and $15 million superior court judge william pounders said he did what he could to limit its length cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case for parents and others there was more to ponder than legal questions life is not fair i tell my children all the time there is no such thing as fair said robert currie whose son attended mcmartin but didn't testify at the trial it's really a travesty for a case to take this long

molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey on 52 molestation charges thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the family-run mcmartin pre-school and they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at children's institute international the private child therapy center which specializes in abused children videotaped interviews with children from the mcmartin school after reports of molestations surfaced jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children asked what led to acquittals juror brenda williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call cii the cii interviews _ i could not accept them mrs williams said i believe the children believe what they were saying was true but at cii i could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them by interviewers or if they were repeating what their parents had told them if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the children a little more' mrs williams said the cii tapes did not help me they gave me a lot of reasonable doubt agreed juror julie peters 47 a supermarket meat wrapper the children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them all the questions were leading they never had a chance to tell their stories said juror john breese 51 a medical technician and grandfather of five i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins 28 an oil company lease operator but if the child was so contaminated by the interviews i couldn't equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the manhattan beach police department to parents of mcmartin school children the letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at the school and to buckey's arrest the police letter should never have been sent said juror sally cordova 27 a supermarket checker it put the information out there too early the whole city knew at that point jurors said they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested one child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to cii mrs williams recalled the panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations including some children's accounts of being molested in a car wash we just dismissed those said mrs williams they said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact because they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos of children's genitals although they acquitted defendants of most charges the jurors deadlocked on 13 counts some said they were unsure whether buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the case were molested _ but not by these defendants even if you accept that the children were molested said juror mark bassett the evidence didn't establish that they were molested at the mcmartin pre-school the panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous toll on defendants as well as children and parents i think everybody is a victim said ms peters i don't think anybody came out of this case a winner i think it's sad because everybody lost something the defendants _ their lives have been ruined they lost their business their reputation it's sad mrs williams added the children have to live with this the parents have to live with this there's nothing i can say that will make it better as for themselves the jurors said their lives were put on hold for nearly three years bassett lost his job as a research computer scientist when his company folded mrs williams got married breese said his wife died during the trial and he has since remarried it's been very hard said mrs williams a telephone company service representative there were days when i thought i couldn't stand it anymore i don't really know my job anymore she said it's going to be

required for a successful criminal prosecution what is in the interest of children is not always in the interest of the legal system she said evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in us history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by macfarlane a social worker and director of the child sexual abuse center at children's institute international macfarlane said thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse this agency would never have gone all the way through what we have if we did not believe these children she said at least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the evidence showed children had been molested but the jurors were sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute the children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them said juror john breese all the questions were leading if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the

words into their mouths she said i tried to enable them to get over their fears macfarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time she called the outcome of the case a tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these children but the institute's executive director mary m emmons said some good

attorney i was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case was brought he said to have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics to criticize me personally

prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 60 minutes interview but reiner calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence the decision we're proud of said the trial took so long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by philibosian this

really sick about it alan lagunoff whose son now 10 testified against the buckeys stood in front of the run-down long-closed nursery school and talked about his disappointment the defense did everything to prolong the case and the prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case properly he said a cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as lagunoff leaned on the rusted

costliest criminal trial in history no decision has been made on retrying ray buckey on 13 undecided counts by lois timnick and carol mcgraw times staff writers ray buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were found not guilty thursday of molesting children at the family-run mcmartin pre-school in manhattan beach a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history an eight-man four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- acquitted the buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years the jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts and a mistrial was declared on those allegations ray buckey 31 left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the 13 undecided counts but his 63-year-old mother and co-defendant reacted with anger i've gone through hell and now we've lost everything she said outside the court my concern was for my son and what they've done to him because my son would never harm a child most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the buckeys were culpable i am not convinced that he ray buckey is innocent said juror sally cordova 27 a supermarket checker but it was not proven to me that he did it whether i believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different the end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom the buckeys who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system had sat silently staring straight ahead as the jury filed into the room shortly before 1030 am and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation all the verdicts are the same said los angeles superior court judge william pounders handing them to his court clerk clerk stan ferrell listed the counts numerically and then reading from the verdict form delivered in a single almost anti-climactic sentence the historic trial's close we the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty the quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs at first the defendants remained stoic then their eyes began to rim with tears ray buckey's lower lip quivered his mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief they said nothing afterward peggy mcmartin buckey insisted she was not bitter i knew god would set my son and me free because we have done nothing she said as she was driven away her optimism was not matched by her son however who she said had had fear definitely about what the jury would decide i held his hand buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced and i told him 'i told you ray' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he didn't the acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history a case that stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a mr ray the case ultimately cost taxpayers more than $15 million altered scores of lives and careers and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse judge pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts i found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place i thought that based on the evidence that was presented the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it it is very difficult to test the credibility of children and when you go beyond that the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration it was very difficult to find corroboration in this case asked if the case was worth its cost in money lives and stress pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case people will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense taking place at preschool and at schools pounders said people are no longer dropping their children off and walking away blindly they look back they check things out more in the crowded courthouse hallways parents of alleged victims lashed out at the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served by the judicial system the system doesn't allow us to protect kids said the father of two alleged victims i have no doubt these children were abused said a tearful mother i guess maybe it's ok to molest kids i can't believe this the children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts we all know that we are telling the truth said a 15-year-old boy who had testified no matter what the jury says whatever anybody says this is the truth we were molested another of the children said that when the clerk read not guilty on the verdict form my stomach just hollowed out i was beyond tears those words will stick with me probably the rest of my life i'll never forget those two words jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods in particular they cited the prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a los angeles child-abuse center they also criticized the manhattan beach police department's decision early in the investigation to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information the children said juror john breese 51 a biomedical technician were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them that was crucial said jury foreman luis chang an electrical engineer the key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes they were too biased too leading that's the main crux of it all said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds not only because the judge had so instructed but also because the disjointed testimony had left them confused i went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as i was the day i first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial said brenda williams 38 a pacific bell service representative i felt i had missed out on something maybe i had dozed off during some important testimony and i was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that i didn't have in mine that would make it all come together said juror mark bassett 33 a computer specialist we just didn't really know what happened deputy dist atty lael rubin who prosecuted the case said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial these counts involve 12 molestation charges against ray buckey and a conspiracy count that accused both him and his mother the conspiracy count against peggy mcmartin buckey was dismissed outright thursday we ultimately must respect the jury's decision rubin said even though i personally disagree with it the system worked well for them she said in reference to the buckeys they were lucky i just hope to god that years from now we don't hear about ray buckey molesting children los angeles county dist atty ira reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial and said he backs two state court-reform initiatives too much time and too much money has gone into this case this is insane the very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational result is preposterous the mcmartin case is the very worst example that we have period but it does not stand alone defense attorneys dean gits and danny davis were beaming after the verdict announcement i feel great gits said indicating he had found hope that the decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count with the acquittal pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that had been posted by buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail buckey's mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail the mcmartin case -- which included allegations not only of rape sodomy oral copulation and other sex crimes but also of pornographic photography sessions naked games field trips away from the school for illicit purposes animal mutilation threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in the fall of 1983 the mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to manhattan beach police that her son had been sodomized by mr ray and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused buckey was arrested in september of that year but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the manhattan beach nursery school among them his grandmother dozens of uncharged suspects and eight other south bay nursery schools the manhattan beach police department sent a form letter to hundreds of mcmartin school parents asking for information and a wave of hysteria swept through the affluent beach town many parents took their youngsters to children's institute international a los angeles child-abuse diagnostic and treatment center for evaluation the majority were told that their children had been victimized in march 1984 ray buckey was rearrested along with his sister peggy ann buckey his mother peggy mcmartin buckey his grandmother virginia mcmartin and teachers betty raidor babette spitler and mary ann jackson a county grand jury had indicted them on 115 counts that indictment was superseded in may by a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children the case was hastily filed and it was flawed from the beginning then-dist atty robert philibosian running for reelection and the media which caught wind of the investigation were pressing for action children's institute international deluged with concerned parents enlisted untrained therapists to assess the children resulting in videotaped interviews filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had been molested hysteria grew hundreds of south bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring it was alleged and an angry mob spray-painted ray must die on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains the 18-month preliminary hearing which began in the fall of 1984 was marked by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors nine defense attorneys and municipal judge aviva bobb and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that lasted in one instance for 16 days los angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a booster chair in their sunday best to face their alleged molesters they munched cookies swigged root beer and sometimes sobbed as they told of their experiences at mcmartin perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped photographed tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier in the end bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges telling each the court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are guilty the remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled child witnesses came forward to testify one child was allowed to testify by closed-circuit television under a new state law passed especially for the mcmartin case but a week later in january 1986 the new district attorney ira reiner who had inherited the case from philibosian dropped charges against five of the seven defendants citing incredibly weak evidence and deciding to proceed only against ray buckey and his mother the trial itself began with jury selection in april 1987 testimony began in july the scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided not to allow their children to testify eventually nine of 11 named victims took the witness stand all sticking to their earlier accounts but for minor inconsistencies toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence they described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of the buckeys their testimony was often raw and unsettling the children's allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians but both buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained their innocence and fellow teachers including former defendants testified that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their knowledge the prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused sexually but silenced for years by threats and also that their child-like efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or misinterpreted the defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school but that the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had happened to them it claimed that their stories defied common sense and that the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated the 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies prompting the judge to comment that it had poisoned everyone it had touched day after day it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre * ailing family matriarch virginia mcmartin now 82 wrote poetry conducted colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts as this awful court these awful people these awful lies * therapist kee macfarlane who conducted many of the interviews in which children first disclosed that they had been molested came under fire when it was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke the story * former prosecutor glenn stevens became a key defense witness after leaking information that he believed that the defendants were innocent and signed a movie contract to tell his revised version of events * a 10-year-old boy testifying at the preliminary hearing identified everyone from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his molesters and painted a picture of marching

mcmartin pre-school criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals a host of civil lawsuits generated by the manhattan beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades legal experts say a confusing array of civil actions await resolution these include a federal civil rights suit filed friday by peggy mcmartin buckey against her accusers and others a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers also ray buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother said his attorney scott bernstein and an attorney representing several parents of mcmartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children i'm convinced this case will never end eli gauna who represents babette spitler a former teacher at the school said wearily it will always be there until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies in the criminal case -- the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us history -- ray buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 were acquitted thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who attended the family nursery school in manhattan beach the jury deadlocked on 13 remaining counts and a mistrial was declared on those allegations a decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against ray buckey the verdict was a high mark but not the final moment in a lengthy and entangled legal saga the criminal case began in march 1984 when seven mcmartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of molestation the indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of 208 counts of molestation and conspiracy after an 18-month preliminary hearing all seven were ordered to stand trial defendants included buckey his mother his grandmother virginia mcmartin who was the school founder his sister peggy ann buckey and teachers spitler betty raidor and mary ann jackson but a week after the hearing ended dist atty ira reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing incredibly weak evidence even before the criminal case went to trial civil litigation already was in the works in 1984 a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations but those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case greg mooney an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue the civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the criminal case mooney said he said friday however that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled mooney said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide what to do with the 13 remaining criminal counts it's impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue mooney said somewhere between a handful and a bushelful any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children the parents could not seek damages on their own because the one-year statute of limitations -- the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed -- has passed under state law children who allege abuse have until they are 19 years old to file many of the children who attended mcmartin are now entering their early teens but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years old legal experts however say some courts have held that child abuse victims can file at any time in their life in the so-called delayed-discovery theory a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years it's a possibility that hangs over the former defendants said attorney gauna noting a recent landmark california court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims mooney said he knows of families that seeking legal advantage waited for the criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action he explained that some families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than in a criminal case the burden of proof in civil litigation is the preponderance of the evidence not reasonable doubt as in a criminal trial also in a civil case only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict criminal convictions require unanimous juries whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings is yet to be seen and some families question whether the mcmartin defendants' insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school there hasn't been any decisions yet the parents need a little space between the events of this week and deciding what they will do mooney said there is some sentiment that says 'let's just put this behind us' but there is also sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the criminal case left off they heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the children they think maybe since the criminal jury couldn't get the higher standard of proof a civil jury would bring about a resolution said one mcmartin attendee's parent who asked not to be identified i might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child but there apparently isn't any money there to be had the only other reasons for filing such a suit the parent added would be to work through a lot of emotional things and we have already done that by participating in the criminal proceedings gauna spitler's attorney said the litigation will go on because maybe a half-dozen to a dozen hard-line parents won't let it go away they will live this case until the day they die meanwhile already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the early defendants peggy ann buckey virginia mcmartin spitler and raidor are suing the television station the reporter who broke the mcmartin story and others the suit alleges that the station and reporter wayne satz were creating rather than reporting the news a lower court held that the station kabc was protected from the action on constitutional grounds but a state appellate court ruled the case should proceed to trial and the state supreme court upheld that decision the case now in the early pretrial stages is being watched closely because it could set precedent in the field of press law experts said another suit pits former mcmartin defendants and the pre-school against their liability insurance carriers the mcmartin side alleges that the insurance carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills while the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs they contend the defendants should have used only one attorney however the defendants are arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest each needed their own counsel one of the former defendants preschool teacher maryann jackson settled out of court as it becomes apparent that mcmartin cases will stretch out for years to come parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one

emmy-winning screenwriter and producer recognized a theme he had tapped before the hysteria of a witch hunt soon mann became a controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie and book deals and thursday's not-guilty verdicts in ray and peggy mcmartin buckey's trial gave mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy at least from his point of view but mann and his wife myra who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for random house and say they are close to finishing a screenplay aren't expected to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old mcmartin case -- or

however one pointed out that the billionaire boys club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials regarding the slayings were over there are no rules the producer said hollywood's role in the mcmartin case came to prominence early not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago several producers pitched projects to networks though no explicit mcmartin story was

the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over but in late 1986 mann released interviews with stevens in which stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an obstruction of justice outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict which would

1985 the church has struggled to shake a mcmartin pupil's allegation during the preliminary hearing that six years earlier he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of st cross when the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church though investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no trace of blood attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run preschool which closed soon afterward the allegations never died despite the passage of time and the announcement by los angeles county sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to support the children's claims periodically over the years eales said he would receive threatening phone calls at the church and rectory and the harassment increased as the mcmartin case began to wind down twice in december the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten eggs in a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack the vandals who identified themselves as the beach cities' conscience warned that there is simply no place for satan worship in this town the harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after christmas of a youth counselor at the church who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he had met through his work at st cross the counselor it turned out was a convicted child molester who had been brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor who was hired after the mcmartin case broke then just days after that assistant pastor resigned the mcmartin verdict came down and according to several church members the anonymous phone calls returned it's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps eales said sunday though at 61 eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement he said his doctors told him that the kind of stress you have been under kills because of that he said he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to st cross his decision shocked and saddened parishioners who credited eales with shepherding the church through difficult times said

otherwise help improve living conditions you mustn't hold a knife to the throat of the government he told strikers saunin from the donetsk region of the ukraine the country's top coal region said the number of striking mines there increased from 20 on tuesday to 58 today now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike as of aug 1 gorbachev said during the parliamentary

elements but said he understood their basic demands government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most of the miners' demands including those on pensions and overtime but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle and the miners are refusing any delay he said central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more control over their industry if the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy we may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing gorbachev said without specifying what steps he would take he said the lost coal production could not be recovered by increasing the mines' output because they already work at full capacity recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the donetsk and kuznetsk

out on strike pressing the government for higher wages but so far the government unlike its predecessors has not caved in it has instead begun legal action to have the strike which today entered its second week declared illegal the miners' position seems untenable romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of dollars 290 a month most workers earn less than dollars 80 workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity the ministry of industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the jiu valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy the region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants which together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity could also be run using lignite and gas the ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market according to the ministry if the miners' pay demands were met the cost of their coal would double even at present prices ukrainian coal is being imported to the romanian market the strike seems motivated by a number of factors the rank and file have come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult conditions in which they live and work they are also following the call of their charismatic leader mr miron cosma the man who led them on protests to bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases mr cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which surprisingly he has the support of rah the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious the ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by mr cosma and several senior rah company officials the company's chief accountant and budget director have already been fired following earlier investigations ministry of industry officials argue the strike could

pavel shushpanov chairman of the executive committee of the 5-month-old independent union of miners front soviet strike spreads miners step up demands most of the country's 12 million coal miners are still working but output in some key regions has been halved saddling gorbachev with a substantial labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the soviet economy the strike is the new union's first major test of strength it began march 1 as a warning action in the karaganda coal field of kazakhstan and the krasnoarmeisk area of the ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's major coal regions the strikers are seeking wage increases of at least 100 percent better working conditions and earlier retirement they claim the government has not kept promises it made to raise miners' living standards as settlement of a nationwide coal strike in july 1989 the 1989 strike which involved more than 500000 miners made only economic demands this time shushpanov said the miners also want three major political concessions first he said they want real sovereignty for the 15 soviet republics they are unhappy with gorbachev's proposed union treaty which would leave the central government in control of the economy defense foreign policy and communications he said second the union is demanding more power for gorbachev's federation council which includes the presidents of all the republics finally the union wants a law on property that would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of land and industry including some mines he said according

labor precious metals stones gold silver pcs commodity news farm products cmd mining metals non-precious min the national union of mineworkers said an estimated 200000 black gold and coal miners in south africa will begin a strike sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation the strike initially would cover more than half of south africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines said cyril ramaphosa the union's general secretary if workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes a total of 300000 miners could be on strike he said gold and coal account for more than half of south africa's foreign-currency earnings the union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on south african financial markets where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike mining companies' shares rose along with the price of gold but the metal's rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the persian gulf the south african rand was slightly firmer mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30% across-the-board wage increase for black miners who the union says earn an average of 225 rand $109 a month the chamber of mines which represents the nation's six biggest mining houses says black miners earn about twice that much it implemented wage increases ranging from 15% to 234% last month anglo american corp the huge south african mining house warned against a strike saying miners had received a good wage increase in july and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action but at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable said mr ramaphosa who added that there hadn't been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received overwhelming support during the week of july 12 he also warned of possible confrontations with police saying we have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves miners' strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police leaving dozens of people dead the total mines that will be affected are 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries the union official said our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies where strike action could take place at any time should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands he said such other companies included de beers consolidated mines ltd the world's largest diamond miner in addition to the general wage increase mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work the black miners also are asking for 30 days' leave each year and a paid holiday on june 16 the anniversary of the 1976 soweto riots they also want

sakharovs at home moscow ap a soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of andrei d sakharov and yelena bonner countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media but the account in moscow news only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the soviet drive into afghanistan indicating that topic is still too sensitive in its latest issue the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of sakharov 66 the 1975 nobel peace prize winner and said the words most often heard in his seventh-floor moscow apartment are help me sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca for soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to return from exile in the closed city of gorky in december 1986 since then sakharov who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb has vocally supported soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev's reform campaign but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights past soviet reports published before gorbachev became soviet leader accused bonner of marrying sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses moscow news depicted the couple as living peacefully and frugally eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and marveled that sakharov a member of the prestigious academy of sciences always does the dishes himself while sakharov was in exile in the closed city of gorky the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview moscow news said sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published the paper said it reported that when the unidentified author refused sakharov said it's too bad that duels are abolished in our times and slapped him sakharov has been quoted numerous times by soviet media since his return from exile but the article in moscow news was the longest devoted to him so far but most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad so relatively few soviets would see the sakharov article as well as appearing in russian moscow news also prints editions in

his wife this week's issue of the newspaper moscow news said that sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the soviet union the article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at sakharov and his wife fellow dissident yelena bonner by soviet officials and the state-controlled media moscow news also pointedly notes that the 1975 nobel peace prize winner has praised mikhail s gorbachev's campaign for social and economic reform the 66-year-old sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventh-floor moscow apartment eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and sakharov insists on washing the dishes afterward himself the paper said it said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking sakharov's aid and that the words most often heard there are help me but moscow news asked can he really do everything although the full-page article was the longest on sakharov to date in the soviet press it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the kremlin's intervention in afghanistan sakharov a brilliant physicist was allowed to return to moscow in december 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of gorky where he was banished without trial in january 1980 in effect sometimes sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work moscow news said of course concerning gorky that's a bitter joke since his return to moscow sakharov has been a vocal supporter of gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of glasnost or greater openness on selected topics he simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy moscow news saidhe calls perestroika restructuring an enormous event for our country and for the entire world however sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the soviet record on human rights and during a jan 15 meeting in the kremlin he handed gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were imprisoned for their views moscow news noted that in 1975 in a tract titled knowledge and the world sakharov set forth his views on soviet affairs those writings have not been published in the soviet union now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then and those ideas that we are putting forward today moscow news said sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the kremlin the human rights activist one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 1970s sought openness in soviet society years before glasnost became communist party policy much of the moscow news article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them it said one soviet book accused the sakharovs of living in oriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses moscow news said sakharov was stubborn unassuming an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life his strong convictions even

slate for sunday's election approved by the leadership in january sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list the official news agency tass quoted him as saying however that scientists were upset not because sakharov was not nominated but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored he called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic decision which produced a list of what critics describe as old-guard managers of scientific institutions a vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for tuesday sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2250-member congress of people's deputies but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an academy of sciences seat under an election law approved in december 750 seats in the legislature are reserved for the communist party and its affiliates and for professional social and trade union organizations the other 1500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 soviet republics and their electoral districts those in the academy who support sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority said andrei mironov a former political prisoner that would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy but it gave five to affiliated societies and associations from 121 nominees the academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats although 60 research institutes nominated sakharov he was not chosen for the final slate the leadership's decision inspired widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's moscow

9 million people as though a government leader had died the huge line of mourners sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against below-zero temperatures stretched a mile from the palace and poured

secret balloting friday at the prestigious lebedev institute the physicists supported sakharov's candidacy by a vote of 1543 to 22 the outcome was more an expression of respect for sakharov as a man

over the kgb security police and the convergence of communism and capitalism although sakharov has publicly expressed his support for president mikhail s gorbachev in recent months he seems to have

blast had been sparked by red-hot debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds the navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri the iowa was headed back to its home port at norfolk va while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at dover

captain both said the explosion in the no 2 turret could have been triggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gun turret but cmdr mark baker chief of the navy's pentagon press office said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a training exercise had been fired he said and all had been from the no 1 turret forward of the one that exploded no eyewitnesses survived wednesday's explosion behind one of the 16-inch guns on the iowa one of the largest warships ever pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the exact cause of the disaster the worst to strike a navy ship since 1977 but two officers _ capt paul hanley a fleet spokesman and capt larry seaquist the ship's former captain _ said a possible explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited new charges but seaquist stressed we simply do not know what caused that powder to go baker said no guns in

safety is at the highest point but i wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that makes a useful platform obsolete adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey began the board of inquiry's investigation hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed seaquist told reporters it seems from the reports that those powders exploded he referred to the six 110-pound sacks of powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1900-pound shell seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from the breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually each gun has a one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3000 pounds of pressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel the only officer killed was lt jg phillip edward buch from las cruces nm who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked or from a shell that cooks off _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round the first thing that comes to mind is something like a cook-off said hanley it could have been a bag or a projectile we just don't know yet none of

rounds four rounds were fired from the no 1 turret and immediately after the commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun in the no 2 turret the explosion occurred capt larry seaquist a former captain of the iowa told reporters earlier in the day it seems from the reports that those powders exploded six 110-pound sacks of powder are rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1900-pound shell naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked but seaquist stressed we simply do not know what caused that powder to go none of the four battleships of the iowa class which saw service in world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars had previously experienced such an explosion pentagon officials said wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the navy since a 1977 accident off spain in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the uss guam and the uss trenton was struck by a spanish freighter except for

which can lob a shell the weight of a volkswagen 23 miles have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age critics say they're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous they all ought to be eliminated retired rear adm eugene larocque of the center for defense information said thursday i don't know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships but the navy defended the 16-inch gun the mightiest in use on any ocean after an explosion killed 47 sailors wednesday aboard the battleship iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice this gun remains the finest naval gun in the world it was the pinnacle of gun design art and it is still a front-line system said capt larry seaquist commander of the iowa until last may the main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel it works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the civil war a shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package in the iowa's case 660 pounds of powder _ six 110-pound bags _ is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2700 pounds at a speed of 2500 feet per second an electric spark ignites the powder the extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel air pressurized to 3000 pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a blowback which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed in newer guns powder is packed in metal containers missiles the backbone of the modern navy's attack capability have integrated propellants capt james bush of the center for defense information a private think tank often critical of pentagon policy said the iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder it wasn't unexpected it wasn't a surprise this is dangerous technology it's archaic bush said these are the only guns in the navy that still used bagged powder the navy said thursday that none of the guns in the iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place the navy also on thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri in a larger sense critics say the battleships themselves once the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy have outlived their purpose despite 16-inch-thick armor plating the battlewagons are vulnerable to submarine and missile attack the 20-mile range of the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances we can do almost anything with a missile and do it better bush said battleships reached their heyday in world war i and were intended to fight other ships the iowa first launched in 1942 was the first of an entire class of us battlewagons built to conquer japan it supported marine amphibious landings and shelled shore targets but the aircraft carrier emerged as the navy's top weapon because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each other the iowa also fought off korea the iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs in the reagan administration's military buildup six years ago they were upgraded with tomahawk cruise missiles 20mm guns and harpoon missiles one of the battleships the new jersey bombarded syrian and druze positions in lebanon as part the us peacekeeping role in 1983 but the 16-inch guns often missed their targets which the navy blamed on unreliable powder from world war ii there was no military need to return these ships to active duty said the cdi's larocque their only military utility is to bombard third world countries and the era of gunboat diplomacy is over ap890421-0186 ap-nr-04-21-89 2325est

greatest test of all in hurricane hugo the storm packing winds of up to 135 mph raged into charleston thursday night this is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in charleston have experienced warned mayor joseph p riley jr hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since hurricane gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959 the seaside community has suffered through many disasters both natural and man-made the worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city killing 32 people injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage charleston a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 1861 the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians of refinement as september gales but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of aug 31 1886 when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to judgement day the great charleston earthquake was felt as far away as chicago and new york city measuring 77 on the richter scale of ground motion the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14000 chimneys into the streets in recent

obviously don't like this and could probably do a better job but everyone knows now because of the media said hurricane specialist max mayfield in the caribbean we were not so certain the word got out but we know the carolinas have been evacuated when a hurricane warning goes into effect it's a $50 million statement said meteorologist joel cline referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted if we weren't here then you wouldn't know that a storm was out there he said before the hurricane warning system was established a storm of hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives but early today after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in charleston and other coastal areas of south carolina i like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives are concerned cline said after hugo's landfall sheets and the other forecasters

hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugo's path into charleston sc all the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite service pinpointing the exact point of hugo's landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that mcadie said we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength the hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships we had no radar or satellites then so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate clark said in the late 1960s the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane then they make an educated guess about the landfall meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true emmanuel said satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path ap890922-0193 ap-nr-09-22-89

limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures said kerry emanuel of the meteorology department at the massachusetts institute of technology but if the seas warm up say by 3 to 6 degrees fahrenheit the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher he said stephen schneider deputy director of the national center for atmospheric research in denver said his research suggests the warming trend is already here schneider an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book global warming said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s he projects that the 1990s will be even hotter hugo demonstrated the effect of warm atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as

models schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked it is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up the caribbean could somehow remain cooler but he said that is unlikley

said it expects claims close to $100 million more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 1985 our previous all-time high was in 1983 when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston there were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm but there was not the severity of damage as in hugo parsons said officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the third-largest insurer in south carolina we have so far received 16000 claims spokesman bob sohozich said although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $7525 million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in 1979 parsons said the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm the new york-based company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york if there is a profit it will be a very small one he said the charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25% he added ghose said shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usf&g corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $16 billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized billions of dollars

by neil macfarquhar associated press writer nicosia cyprus ap iraqi president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979 the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below $14 per barrel he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries he also accused kuwait of stealing $24 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war saddam was reported to be incensed that kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran never mind that iraq started the war in 1980 by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shatt-al-arab waterway iraq's only outlet to the gulf despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraq's development dragging on for eight years it has still not formally ended the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war the 1990 budget slashed funds for imports and iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity private investment has failed to take hold iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt its main gulf port of basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated 500000 iraqis were killed or wounded despite its puny size kuwait's oil reserves almost match iraq's 100 billion barrels by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline iraq's 100000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraq's demands but kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddam's promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers although a civil war in yemen in the 1960s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait the invasion shook kuwait's neighbors along the gulf it proved the decade-old gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless the gcc did not issue a statement much less implement its mutual defense treaty while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraq's chemical weapons _ banned under international law _ if iraq was attacked it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the arab-israeli conflict then britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into

while refusing to rule out the use of us troops to rescue kuwait from its iraqi invaders the trade embargo bars imports of oil from iraq which account for 3% to 4% of total us oil supplies officials

far to iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor but it stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate kuwait officials but according to bush administration

scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit aspen institute on sunday bush said that secretary of state james a baker iii will discuss the persian gulf situation with soviet officials in moscow today in ulan bator mongolia where baker was on an asian visit a baker spokeswoman said that the united states and the soviet union plan to issue a joint statement later today condemning the iraqi invasion of kuwait baker will meet with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on a brief refueling stop in moscow the meeting was arranged after baker met with the soviet ambassador to mongolia who described the kremlin's plans for a strong soviet stand on the invasion baker at a news conference in ulan bator early today said there have been no reports of us casualties in kuwait and that the integrity of foreign embassies seems to have been preserved so far he said the estimate of the number of iraqi troops in kuwait varies from 50000 to 100000 bush flew to colorado after meeting early in the morning with his national security council to discuss the persian gulf situation originally the president had planned to spend the night in colorado and return to washington today instead he returned to washington on thursday night before leaving the capital thursday morning bush told reporters at the white house that he was not contemplating any us military involvement but later in the day at the news conference with thatcher bush moved away from that pledge he said that he had met during the day with top defense advisers and we're not ruling any options out the trade embargo imposed by bush would cut off all commerce with iraq except news reporting exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief supplies of food and medicine like bush thatcher has frozen iraqi and kuwaiti assets but she has not imposed a trade embargo iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and considerable national debt but europe and japan are far more dependent on middle eastern oil than is the united states and an international oil embargo on iraq would be painful for many us allies at the joint news conference thatcher called for un actions to impose additional trade sanctions against iraq asked about an oil embargo however she stopped short we are prepared to support in the un security council those measures which collectively we can agree to and which collectively we can make effective she said those are the two tests bush spent the day discussing the iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other heads of state including the heads of egypt yemen and jordan arab leaders whom the president described as friends of the united states the arab leaders bush said had appealed to him for restraint and a short period of time in which to develop an arab solution bush expressed sympathy with the arab effort but added that i made clear to them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute later thursday the white house said that bush had spoken with king fahd of saudi arabia for about 30 minutes the statement said the two leaders agreed that the invasion was unacceptable and discussed possible options for dealing with the situation at a news conference in washington kuwaiti ambassador saud appealed to the united states for military assistance my people are suffering saud said adding that kuwait is requesting aid from everyone who has conscience and fair play around this world referring to kuwait's request for us military intervention he said we don't stand a chance if we don't get aid from our friends mashat baghdad's ambassador to the united states said in a statement given to reporters in washington that iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few days or weeks the events currently occurring in kuwait are an internal affair with which iraq has no relation mashat said meanwhile the united states asked iraq to account for the six missing american oil company employees in kuwait times staff

looking for some of the thousands of westerners based in kuwait or caught by the invasion more than 1 million foreigners live and work in kuwait several hundred britons americans and west germans were

invasion troops iraq's oil revenues totaled more than $11 billion last year it has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the 1980-88 war with iran and settle foreign debts of up to $80 billion one of the reasons iraq gave for invading kuwait was kuwaiti reluctance to slow its flow of oil and push oil prices higher but it was iraqi oil that had slowed today there are very few tankers loading iraqi oil at yumurtalik a senior turkish government official said referring to the export jetties on the turkish side of the mediterranean sea in baghdad president saddam hussein ordered drills for millions of people in case mass evacuations were needed he warned his nation's 17 million people to be on alert for possible us or israeli attacks the united states has

teammates of the track legend this saturday marks the 10th anniversary of owens' death at age 66 the president later hailed owens's multiple gold medals in the berlin games a victory for humanity in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the us olympic committee the olympics like democracy are a kind of dialogue _ a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition not deadly conflict bush said bush called owens who was black an olympic hero and an american hero every day of his life born with the gift of burning speed he was always the fastest said bush recalling

from ruth owens said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned owens the congressional gold medal owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as a special ambassador for sports said bush he said the athlete's legacy lives on through the jesse owens games a playground olympics the jesse owens international trophy for amateur

finals by peter berlin tonight in the big stadium in barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals tonight it is nation versus nation what the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries - or to those rather that choose to lavish resources on athletes the us has comfortably won the most relay medals followed by britain the former soviet union the former west germany not even counting the six won before 1939 the former east germany france and canada britain alone have won more relay medals 23 than all the caribbean islands nine and africa four including one for south africa the dutch with one have more relay medals than all the nations of asia nil and south america nil combined the cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and 1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay medals with a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays always require a little luck - the developing countries will continue the gentle redistribution of medals but although they have talent few can match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers the us 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to danny everett even so they rested steve lewis the 400m silver medallist in last night's semi-finals in the 4x100m heats james jett replaced carl lewis but lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth olympic gold one thing that became clear on thursday when lewis won his seventh gold with victory in the long jump was that while winning at the olympics may bring other athletes excitement or relief lewis simply adores the experience when voula patoulidou looking up at the giant video screen after the women's 100m hurdle final suddenly realised to her astonishment that she had won a gold medal she went delightfully and utterly potty as did the other 25 greeks in the stadium including queen sofia of spain lewis on the other hand seemed unsurprised when mike powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump even though the long jump had not finished and even though 5000m runners were trudging through a semi-final lewis began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour he tried to orchestrate a mexican wave this is a man who derives immense pleasure from

lipman wsj staff gis mcd mkt the 1984 summer olympic games weren't even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast mary lou retton she went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements -- surely an olympic record in itself but when the 1988 summer games ended sunday night so too did the chance for american athletes to follow in her footsteps ad agency executives who spend every fourth year glued to their tv sets hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' products say that this olympiad was a dud i suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the olympics says jerry della femina chairman of ad agency della femina mcnamee wcrs this is the first olympics without passion and without passion you don't have testimonials without heroes you don't have anyone that anyone wants to emulate on the surface the games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts who could forget diver greg louganis smacking his head on the springboard then coming back to win two gold medals or flamboyant florence griffith joyner her two-inch fingernails raking the air as she won the 100-meter sprint but even these two along with jackie joyner-kersee who won the women's heptathalon and the long jump may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank the fact is say many marketers olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster i don't think it's big money like it used to be says michael goldberg of national media group inc the new york sports-marketing firm that represents ms retton it used to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an olympic athlete it just doesn't happen anymore certainly this year's winning olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sports-equipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups but the major high-paying endorsements -- such as those with soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets -- just don't seem to be surfacing at least not yet earlier this year sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the summer games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements now marketers say these medalists will be lucky to pull in $100000 to $500000 a year advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these olympics aren't igniting much spark for one thing they suffer by comparison with the 1984 summer games so exciting because they were held in los angeles and because in the absence of boycotting soviet-bloc countries the americans won 83 gold medals the 1988 games by contrast were broadcast from halfway around the world and the soviets trounced the americans 55 gold medals to 36 what's more marketers say this year's drug scandals cast a pall over the games especially the incident involving canadian sprinter ben johnson who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids nbc's tv coverage also gets its share of the blame marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build the constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn't help either during most of the past games there was enough continuous tv coverage so that much like a soap opera it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition says leigh steinberg attorney for ice-skater brian boitano a gold medalist at the 1988 winter games but not this summer he says recent changes in olympic rules meanwhile have led to a glut of olympians in search of endorsement deals before the 1984 games most olympic athletes weren't allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status now they can appear in as many ads as they want but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses every year more and more olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials -- basically everybody is available says daisy sinclair a vice president with ad agency ogilvy group inc as a result while once an aura surrounded an olympian now the bloom is off companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements increasingly cost conscious they will no longer hook up with an olympian just because the company president likes the athlete's sport and after years of paying big bucks to olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity companies have finally gotten the hint that olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety if you think your phone will ring off the hook if you win a gold medal it isn't going to happen anymore says stephen disson senior vice president of marketing for proserv inc a washington sports-marketing firm companies now know that six months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events for them to consider ad agency bbdo worldwide's attitude toward the olympics is becoming typical it uses sports stars in its commercials for pepsi light and oppenheimer mutual funds but has no plans to call on any of 1988's olympians i prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis like football and basketball players says charles miesmer the agency's executive creative director people like michael jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers all in a row so i don't have to worry about the public saying 'carl who' and don't look for any of 1988's winners to start showing up on wheaties boxes either general mills inc which has featured ms retton and decathalon gold-medalist bruce jenner on its wheaties boxes in the past says it looks for three qualities in an endorser career achievement popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments a spokeswoman says that none of this year's crop meet all three criteria so far ms joyner-kersee has had the most visible endorsements even before the olympics began she had made commercials for primatene mist and 7-up and according to her agent pearl hodge of world class management she is now in the process of signing with mcdonald's corp to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children ms joyner-kersee's sister-in-law ms griffith joyner may soon take the endorsement lead advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winners the sprinter's manager couldn't be reached for comment another olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer matt biondi who won five gold medals mr biondi has already signed a swim-wear contract with arena usa inc and parkes brittain his agent at advantage international inc says his client will definitely be in a high-income ring the highest you can name then there is mr louganis since winning two gold medals during the 1984 summer olympics the diver has had little luck with major endorsements and a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential when most advertisers are looking for the male hero the word 'macho' trails along very closely says marty blackman of blackman & raber a sports-marketing firm in new york i don't find louganis a macho guy still other marketing professionals say that mr louganis's dramatic recovery after smashing his head has secured the diver's future his manager jim babbitt won't comment on any contract offers he will say however that his client has done just fine he isn't unhappy he dives to perform he doesn't dive for dollars --- winning

president corazon aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision the controversy climaxed thursday with the resignation of secretary-designate florencio abad 35 whose nomination was opposed by the pro-aquino struggle of the democratic filipino party handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which mrs aquino has been criticized lack of clear priorities tactical blundering and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy it also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric mrs aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 people power uprising against the late ferdinand marcos the sincerity of corazon aquino is being seriously questioned wrote columnist ninez cacho-olivares in the philippine daily inquirer land reform the centerpiece program of her administration is dead abad's troubles began in february when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in cavite province to japan's marubeni corp for an industrial park although the deal was approved by the national development corp abad a former congressman said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program the department of trade and industry said the marubeni deal was crucial to attracting much-needed foreign investment for the government's industrialization program but the department of agrarian reform said if the cavite land was exempted hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title the presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders from mrs aquino abad's firm stand however alarmed landowners in congress who floated rumors in the press that the agrarian reform department was riddled with communists lawmakers on the commission on appointments who belong to the pro-aquino struggle of the democratic filipino party blocked abad's confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned despite the party's victory poltical damage to it and mrs aquino was considerable the manila press transformed abad into a folk hero depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the struggle of the democratic filipino party dubbed landlord-dominated party worry not about abad's destiny mrs president wrote columnist carol arguillas in the manila chronicle worry about yours and how you blew the last chance for liberal support mrs aquino pledged publicly to work for abad's confirmation but her lobbying appeared ineffectual abad's strongest opponents included politicians who consistently support mrs aquino leading to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed abad's opponents included her younger brother rep jose peping cojuangco who wields considerable influence in government there is no way cory aquino will challenge peping said one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity mrs aquino comes from a landlord family she and her brothers and sisters are partners in a 14500-acre sugar plantation in tarlac province rather than break up the estate they used a legal option and created a profit-sharing plan for the tenants the abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the agrarian reform program once touted as the centerpiece of the administration last year agrarian reform secretary philip juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land his successor miriam defensor santiago was repeatedly rejected by the commission on appointments only to be reappointed until mrs aquino replaced her with abad on dec 31 no reason for the change was given but mrs santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to mrs aquino during a coup attempt in early december agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions of peasants the program was advertised as essential in curbing the 21-year-old rural-based marxist insurgency mrs aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but left details to congress the final

condition in honolulu where he has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986 hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly friday but remained in extremely critical condition the 71-year-old former president has been suffering from heart lung and kidney disorders as well as pneumonia his frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life doctors in hawaii said medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart medication but that he could die at any time radio stations here broadcast hourly reports on marcos' condition philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the aquino government's refusal to allow marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death one radio station broadcast an interview with marcos' wife imelda at the st francis medical center in honolulu where she was said to be maintaining a vigil at his bedside she was quoted as appealing to aquino to open her heart and allow marcos to return to the philippines aquino said she would not alter her position but that she had prayed for marcos' recovery i regret to inform mrs marcos that as much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of filipinos aquino told reporters at the presidential palace i have said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incident nonetheless marcos supporters announced that they will march through the capital today to support the former president's demand that he be allowed to die in the philippines despite charges that marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars the former president still has a significant following here in the philippines personal loyalty is considered a sacred debt attempted coups government officials have accused marcos supporters of taking part in at least two attempted coups against the aquino government aquino evidently is concerned that even after death the return of marcos' remains could spark violence or galvanize opposition to her government aquino's national security adviser rafael ileto told reporters friday that the philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president he was quoted as saying that while marcos is no longer a threat to the government his supporters can still cause disruption marcos' mother josefa died a year ago but because marcos has been barred from this country the family refuses to have her remains interred a newspaper advertisement published on the first anniversary of her death may 4 said

military revolt on the philippines' second-largest island leaves president corazon aquino's beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead analysts here say aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army col alexander noble on the north coast of mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government is indecisive and inept and despite widespread fears that the oct 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to aquino leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move it was the coup attempt that didn't catch fire one western diplomat said it sort of fizzled before anything could happen but he and other diplomats see little benefit for aquino's battered image overseas the international consequence is people saying 'yet another revolt in the philippines' it's like she's under a perpetual onslaught he said moreover questions linger as to how noble and about 350 rebel troops so easily evaded a much-publicized military manhunt to drive 140 miles from their mountain sanctuary pass unhindered through at least 10 military checkpoints and seize two military camps including the command post of the general who had been ordered to capture him -- all without firing a shot noble once chief of staff of aquino's own security detail quickly linked up with reuben canoy a local politician who heads the so-called mindanao independence movement the resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th century -- though canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of us $5 bills the whole thing was kind of a farce one asian diplomat said only in the philippines noble best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and higaonon tribal militiamen after two world war ii-vintage t-28 planes called tora toras here bombed and strafed one of the camps one plane later crashed and the pilot drowned the revolt's only fatality aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and aborted military mutinies most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on for days as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other soldiers in one case mutineers were ordered to do push-ups and attend bible class as punishment this time was a different government response altogether which noble clearly had underestimated said university of the philippines political scientist alex magno he expected another standoff and hoped for other camps to defect he got bombed instead after the revolt the government toughened its anti-coup law boosting the maximum penalty from 12 years to life in prison aquino's spokesman tomas gomez iii urged other rebel leaders to take the honorable way out -- suicide ironically noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last december's coup attempt in manila which left more than 100 people dead after 332 witnesses 226 sworn statements and 4100 documents the so-called davide commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue -- but unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future commission member delfin lazaro estimated that 70 officers involved in last december's coup attempt which came closest to toppling aquino are still at large and still plotting it's going to be very difficult for them to get

the right to try to seize power laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to president corazon aquino's forces as she has demanded he predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from cebu mindanao and other islands i don't think this is going to end right away he said in a suite in the peninsula hotel here i think it's going to be a long protracted thing even civil war although he grinned broadly and laughed often during the interview laurel denied that he was cheering for the rebels he refused however to condemn their use of violence against a constitutionally elected government i don't want to prejudge their goals or objectives he said everybody should try to win with a ballot rather than a bullet he added but democracy does not preclude that as a last resort laurel who is known as doy broke with aquino shortly after they took office in 1986 following a popular uprising that toppled former president ferdinand e marcos since then laurel has criticized aquino frequently in his role as head of the opposition nacionalista party laurel said he was in london early friday when the philippine fighting began he flew to hong kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the philippines' two international airports in manila and cebu have been closed since the fighting began laurel said 18 nacionalista leaders were meeting at the intercontinental hotel in manila late saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel he called the group his party's junta but said they have no ties to the rebels

drop bombs or fire but laurel said the us fighter-bombers destroyed a philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at sangley point and fired rockets that killed civilians near camp aguinaldo

two largest us military facilities abroad are beginning laurel's companion homobono adaza a former member of parliament under marcos and a nacionalista member also defended the rebels these are the reformist elements he said they are trying to reform the government laurel said the coup occurred because aquino failed to unite the nation or the armed forces leading to divided loyalties and

political backlash leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's islamic leadership say the regime is very much fearful of public outrage said shahin gobadi spokesman for the people's mojahedin of iran they're very much afraid of the political aftershocks as gobadi spoke friday members of the organization denounced iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the white house northern iran was stuck thursday by an earthquake measuring between 73 and 77 on the richter scale iran has told the united nations that the death toll is at least 36000 but gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100000 gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring iraq and against internal opposition they have been very late in assisting the people he said sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting flag-waving rally participants who also carried signs criticizing their native country planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake but part of the friday's activities focused on iran's stricken residents gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life this regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery this regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with iraq and to oppression of the people at home he said a un-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight years of the iran-iraq war iran's islamic republic was established in 1979 after shah mohammad reza pahlavi was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and militants seized the us embassy in tehran taking 66 americans hostage the united states

advanced anti-seismic building construction systems even after its expulsion from iran the us government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots halted the renovation of the

money informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50000 in cash to the red crescent society to be used to help needy iranians

vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had cracked his joke all of a sudden i saw water just come flying in he said and it was maybe two seconds and the boat rolled right over the 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry's cabin frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank i started breathing in water and almost died vickery said if i had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds i wouldn't be lying here right now i'd be in one of those body bags out there when he made his way to the surface he found guys floating everywhere screaming and yelling like chaos despite his own predicament he grabbed a struggling fellow sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating plastic foam life ring one rescue boat already overloaded passed by and threw life preservers in what seemed like an hour another boat came also full so they just dragged us through the water back to the saratoga and i was a real happy person to see those guys

suction of the sinking boat clinging to a foam plastic float he was passed by one rescue boat and hit by a second i looked around and i see this big hull coming at me and we were all yelling but i guess the ship didn't see us he said i was trying to get out of the way but i got hit by the ship dazed benjamin stripped off his jacket shirt and shoes and kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling to i was scared he admitted i was having a hard time staying up in the water a rescue ship picked him up he estimated about a half hour to 45 minutes later two other men interviewed at rambam hospital identified themselves as technician john richards 31 of twin lake mich and airman lamont jones 20 of claremont va both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks

reign japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the pacific conflict in world war ii shortly after that decision and for most of his reign hirohito became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love the study of marine biology he was the last survivor among the national leaders of the world war ii era but in his first 20 years the son of heaven was worshiped as a divinity descended from the sun goddess amaterasu the solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne at the age of 25 on christmas day 1926 designating his reign showa _ enlightened peace the emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out japan's military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s but it was his first effective decision as emperor and his most courageous that ended the pacific conflict on aug 10 1945 four days after history's first atomic bomb devastated hiroshima and one day after a us bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on nagasaki the generals and admirals of imperial japan's wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the tokyo palace should japan agree to the allies' surrender demand or fight on until annihilation speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone hirohito the spiritual and titular leader offered his opinion for the first time he spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war and of families who lost everything in air raids i cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer he said ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened then evoking a memory of his grandfather the emperor meiji whose reign 1867-1912 saw the end of 250 years of feudal japanese isolation from the outside world hirohito told the officers the time has come when we must bear the unbearable in the days that followed hirohito continued his break with tradition in a national radio broadcast aug 15 _ the first time ordinary japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally announced the decision to surrender he told the ravaged nation that the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage three weeks later hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped trousers and a top hat to meet the allied commander gen douglas a macarthur at the us embassy in tokyo it was the first time hirohito had ever gone to see anyone and the first of several calls on the general who had led the pacific war against japan and became its postwar governor on new year's day 1946 at macarthur's insistence the emperor publicly renounced his divinity it was a choice that enabled hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal as some abroad had demanded it also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a living god the emperor's status in the eyes of many japanese changed to that of a kind uncle he became a widely respected authority on marine biology he possessed rare collections of marine life discovered several species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty in recent years his life had become the subject of a popular comic book series still hirohito and the imperial system remained important to japan a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper mainichi shimbun in march 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2184 people polled supported the imperial system while only 11 percent said it should be abolished five percent said the emperor should have more power from 1946 to 1954 hirohito toured japan to encourage the people to rebuild the imperial household agency which ran his affairs said hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 31 million japanese lives despite the humanization of the imperial family hirohito remained under strict control of the imperial household agency protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited from speaking on any controversial subject hirohito was born on april 29 1901 in accordance with age-old imperial custom he was taken from his parents as an infant to be reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one role that of emperor his education came as japan surged into the modern world the feudal samurai ethic was still strong when his grandfather died gen maresuke nogi the mentor for the 11-year-old prince calmly committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor his master to the grave hirohito studied government and law with private tutors when he was 20 his father emperor taisho sent him abroad _ the first time any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside japan hirohito visited england scotland france belgium the netherlands and italy receiving various decorations he was also received by pope benedict xv the young man handled money for the first time paying his own fare on the paris subway he developed a passion for bacon and eggs and it became a lifelong breakfast habit a palace chamberlain said in a 1980 interview that hirohito shunned japanese food unless it is forced on him by an unwitting host hirohito also acquired a preference for western clothes he was never seen in public wearing traditional japanese garb and a palace official confided that the emperor of japan did not even own a kimono hirohito became prince regent on nov 25 1921 after his father became a mental and physical invalid became emperor five years later and was formally enthroned in 1928 more

part 5 page 4 column 6 letters desk 230 words death of hirohito the death of emperor hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the world war ii era one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the european or asian continents the political and military role that emperor hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us he may not have had that kind of influence now but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in japan with religious vigor at the surrender of the imperial japanese government hirohito was spared punishment because it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors i found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age in his position in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries of course some japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for i often wonder if hirohito ever felt grateful to those generals who were sacrificed in part so that he could live for another 43 years i only wish that the soul of emperor hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war

revelation's significance was not immediately clear although it appeared to suggest that the attack at cleveland elementary was not altogether random police officials said they still had not determined what set off purdy a troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with the law the midday attack which lasted only minutes ended when purdy mortally wounded himself in the head with a pistol leaving his motive unexplained i don't understand why and i probably won't ever know why said purdy's grandmother 63-year-old julia chumbley who lives nearby in lodi other relatives described purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced across america looking for work as a welder cleveland elementary was in session today although only a little more than 200 pupils -- roughly one-fourth of the student body -- showed up for classes those who did attend were greeted at the school by escorts who guided them through a thicket of reporters and cameras counselors were stationed in each classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the previous day each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's office teachers said they did not know what to expect i'll just try to get through the day said vicki braga who teaches fourth grade the front entrance of the school was decorated with bouquets of yellow gladioli purple mums and five red roses someone also had placed there a pink teddy bear with angel's wings a banner stretched across the front said racists are ugly -- let's stop them the banner's message enunciated an early suspicion that the racial composition of the student body might have contributed to purdy's motivation more than 600 of the 980 students are the sons and daughters of refugees from southeast asia police however said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role whether he had some feelings against the southeast asian community as a whole we haven't determined that said stockton

behavior officials said he transferred out in the third grade to a school in sacramento police investigators last night searched the lodi motel room where purdy had been staying he had checked in the day after christmas and was paid up through jan 23 they found more than 100 plastic toy soldiers arrayed about the room along with toy jeeps and tanks in what appeared to be a imaginary battle scene

it was reported today cbs estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game down only 2 million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout on the upside for cbs -- super bowl xxiv carried enough of its audience over to the debut of the new series grand slam to provide a good audience sampling and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night it was cbs' bad luck that the game was so predictably lopsided which resulted in the lowest rating since super bowl iii in 1969 each rating point in 1990 however represents many more households than it did

from concessions and the sale of novelty items competing against the rose bowl are san diego san francisco and phoenix because the rose bowl has 102083 seats the council selected it as the prime venue under a joint agreement the coliseum and anaheim stadium did not submit competing bids but they would share in the revenues if pasadena gets the game said ed aghjayan pasadena's deputy city manager the bulk of the revenue would go to the rose bowl but the idea is that we would share with the coliseum and anaheim aghjayan said details of the split are still being negotiated one plan calls for the rose bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds with the two other facilities sharing 25% pasadena earned $300000 from the 1983 super bowl and $800000 in 1987 the money coming from stadium rental fees concession sales admission taxes charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees in addition the city was allowed to buy 1200 tickets at face value for local distribution by directors and other city officials but as bidding for the super bowl has become more competitive the nfl has taken more of the income aghjayan said in a report to the city's board of directors in most parts of the country the stadium is offered rent-free in exchange for the benefits to local economies he said under the proposal for the 1993 game the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the nfl it also would provide 350000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent compound the city would receive about $79000 from seat taxes $75000 in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about $55000 in parking fees the board has approved the proposal the rose bowl meanwhile has proposed an $83-million project to renovate the press

about money carley said last week and last time we were basically onlookers things are a lot different this time around this year carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of super bowl week the bambaleo parade a saturday extravaganza with marching bands a street festival and floats the grand marshal of the parade will be lee roy selmon a former tampa bay buccaneer other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a doug williams golf tournament 'much more involvement' this year the super bowl task force a group headed by two of the city's most influential white businessmen named two black men to head a community-relations committee but perhaps most important carley said several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the nfl for the game there's much more involvement this time black and white said carley who is the affirmative-action officer for hillsboro community college there's been a heightened awareness in 1984 there was not even a thought given to a black man about 100000 visitors many of them corporate and political movers and shakers were expected to arrive in tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game sunday the game itself which is televised to 750 million people around the world is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention hotels restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues with a total economic impact of $200 million 'it's a bay window' the super bowl introduces you to the world in a big way said barbara casey the coordinator of the super bowl task force you don't have to say tampa fla anymore the super bowl also can highlight a community's problems and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface it's more than a window into a town said jim steeg director of special events for the nfl it's a bay window last month nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 super bowl out of tempe ariz because the state does not have a holiday honoring dr martin luther king a week before the super bowl in miami two years ago the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an hispanic police officer in the predominantly black overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars while the disturbances were not caused by the super bowl the nfl was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities i think miami was the awakening for a lot of people carley said in tampa super bowl xxv brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years the gasparilla parade an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city's most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the nfl for the super bowl but after tampa was awarded the 1991 super bowl a racial dispute erupted over the parade which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white all-male private club ye mystic krewe of gasparilla the club's top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents including carley that the club be integrated immediately instead they canceled the parade the super bowl task force had to scramble to put together a new parade and carley became the co-chairman of that effort super bowl xxvi super bowl xxvi will be played jan 26 1992 in the metrodome it will be minneapolis' first time

bowl and the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense still the new rules do change things for a variety of super bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a super bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs one big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the super bowl only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted if a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1500 -- the going rate -- it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value or $60 even to get the 80% deduction there still must be a substantial and bona fide business discussion before during or after the game says julian block a tax specialist at prentice-hall information services inc to take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough mr block says and if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient the tougher irs rule however hasn't slowed ticket demand even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each even if it weren't tax deductible it'd be worth it says tom foley chairman of bibb co a macon ga maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the national football league team logos bibb is flying about 20 people -- mostly customers -- to the game we get more earnings from the trip than the expense says mr foley some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules a spokesman for adolph coors & co the golden colo brewery said its tax advisers instructed executives that this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed under the old law meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-super bowl banquet since the new tax law has a banquet meeting exception such meetings must have at least 40 persons half of whom are away from home and there must be a speaker executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the super bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor says william j lipton tax partner of the accounting firm ernst & whinney if a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill he or she must talk business with all of the guests mr lipton says one safety measure make a business-oriented speech mr block suggests he also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection that will be a big job for barron hilton chairman of hilton hotels corp who along with alex

riley jr hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since hurricane gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959 the seaside community has suffered through many disasters both natural and man-made the worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city killing 32 people injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage charleston a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 1861 the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians of refinement as september gales but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of aug 31 1886 when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to judgement day the great charleston earthquake was felt as far away as chicago and new york city measuring 77 on the richter scale of ground motion the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14000 chimneys into the streets in recent years the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who

several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugo's path into charleston sc all the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administration's satellite service pinpointing the exact point of hugo's landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that mcadie said we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength the hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships we had no radar or satellites then so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate clark said in the late 1960s the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane then they make an educated guess about the landfall meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true emmanuel said satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path ap890925-0054 ap-nr-09-25-89 0631edt r a pm-hugo-readiness 09-25 0321 pm-hugo-readiness0336 loss of life low because people were prepared with pm-hugo bjt by

hurricane hugo may be most costly storm ever 2 biggest insurers in carolinas estimating losses at $600 million by linda williams times staff writer the two dominant home and automobile insurers in the

industry state farm insurance co expects claims as high as $400 million in south carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman jerry parsons said the bloomington ill-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in north carolina and virginia he said additionally nationwide insurance co said it expects claims close to $100 million more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 1985 our previous all-time high was in 1983 when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston there were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm but there was not the severity of damage as in hugo parsons said officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the third-largest insurer in south carolina we have so far received 16000 claims spokesman bob sohozich said although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $7525 million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in 1979 parsons said the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm the new york-based company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york if there is a profit it will be a very small one he said the charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25% he added ghose said shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usf&g corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $16 billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized billions of dollars in losses from hugo and other catastrophes this year would have a significant impact on excess capital he said causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly that would be good for the companies and shareholders he said

books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately analysts and company officials say the property claims service division of the american insurance service group a trade association is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record said one official far surpassing the $7525 million insurers paid out after frederick ripped through several gulf coast states in 1979 the impact on premium rates could be minimal for now analysts expect because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future in the last three years hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds and since hugo also stormed through the caribbean foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands yet some analysts believe hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months rates have been falling since late 1986 udayan ghose at shearson lehman hutton inc believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990 for the time being the losses from hugo will be substantial but they won't be something the industry can't handle said charles l ruoff director of strategic planning at fred s james & co a new york-based insurance broker for instance state farm mutual automobile insurance co estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses nationwide insurance co a mutual company based in columbus ohio said hugo is the single largest claims disaster it has seen in its 63-year history the company which is the largest home and auto insurer in north carolina and no 3 in south carolina has already received 16000 claims from the stricken region claims could total $100 million a spokesman said for some insurers hugo was a double-whammy new york-based continental corp which is a big insurer in puerto rico the virgin islands and south carolinas said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane hugo will be particularly costly to us said john p mascotte continental's chairman philadelphia-based cigna corp which has extensive domestic foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas hugo hit and usf&g corp in baltimore a big insurer in the carolina region could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings analysts said some of usf&g's losses hit very close home -- its charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane both usf&g and cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge

mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite good morning discovery i guess you're awake after that song said kathy thornton shuttle communicator there are a lot of happy people down here we saw a great deploy yesterday and hubble had a good night while you were asleep we appreciate the good words from everybody replied discovery commander loren shriver after wednesday's deployment shriver gently backed discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park discovery in orbit 46 miles behind hubble the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work you've done replied mission control galileo is real proud of you scientists have hailed the hubble _ nasa's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to directional commands the next milestone is friday when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished 945-inch mirror to starlight then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina data will follow in a month or two if the aperture door doesn't open properly discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened we want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay one of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge but there was trouble with the second panel it wouldn't budge when the latches were released and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again the panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown the 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above earth 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown the orbit was dictated by the need to put hubble above the earth's distorting atmosphere astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach earth they hope to determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated at 15 billion years ago the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force base calif ap900426-0185

must say said al boggess hubble project scientist at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md applause erupted at goddard's space telescope operations control center when the high-speed contact was made thursday afternoon controllers sent information to the telescope about its location and this basically improved the telescope's knowledge where it was what its position was said goddard's dave drachlis they also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two high-speed dish antennas we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the high-gain antenna system drachlis reported the antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem boggess said this probably won't be the last time we have a problem he said we'll keep working at it until we have all these things that need to be done done we'll get them right the problem began thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated tdrs satellites without success two low-speed antennas were working fine but boggess said they would be excruciatingly slow for sending data there had been a communications outage with the telescope earlier it lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error in addition one of four rate gyros wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately but it was restored later and the stability of the satellite was unaffected the problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use said jean oliver hubble deputy project manager at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work boggess said having done it once we've got confidence we can do it and that means the mission can proceed space shuttle discovery trailed 57 miles behind the

telescope he said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing discovery's astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some last-minute observations of earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe it's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden it makes little kids' eyes light up it makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science the telescope's big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite the antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly we expect to use that data to investigate what happened he said engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed we're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in effect a standby mode he said shortly after 6 am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor hubble's health it will take another day before the $15 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier we're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems olivier said friday this is not the time to do anything dumb the telescope problems

just before the olympic closing ceremony the last and one of the most prestigious events of the games will be held it is also without doubt the most gruelling run in high heat high humidity high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course the barcelona olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run there are lots of figures to show why it is estimated that when the race begins in mataro a seaside town north of barcelona the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`c towards the marathon's end however radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`c more debilitating still relative humidity in barcelona in august rises as high as 80 per cent with more than 10 kilometres still to go most of the course is an upward run the last 46km which take the runners 60m higher still to the olympic stadium at the top of the hill of montjuic has an average gradient of more than 45 per cent and includes some sections of 7 per cent equivalent in skiing terms to a steep 'red' run but we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary difficulty of tomorrow's race last saturday in the olympic stadium i watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions never in any event voluntarily entered into sporting or otherwise have i seen such signs of physical and mental distress the race was won by the unified team's valentina yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding olympic marathon courses in los angeles and seoul after her nearest competitor japan's yuko arimori came in eight seconds later they had the energy - between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile for the cameras it was a different story in the 'mixed zone' the area under the stadium where athletes recover after their events as runner after runner stumbled and limped into the room - several were brought in senseless on stretchers - the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued after weeks of exposure and deprivation at sea as a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face manuela machado of mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as water was poured over them others stood hunched over grasping their abdomens if anyone moved at all it was with agonised faces and the slowest of hobbles these are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm for marathon running or for the ideals of olympic competition chris brasher organiser of the london marathon was on hand to witness the suffering and was incensed male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat humidity and an over-demanding terrain he said in his opinion gearing the marathon to prime-time tv viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism 'to put on the marathon in the late afternoon rather than first thing in the morning the normal practice and then to make them run 4km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion' said brasher a former olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter i spoke to britain's steve brace winner of the paris marathon in 1989 and 1990 the berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the barcelona event he agrees that the run will be highly demanding and while he regards olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career he is cautious about tomorrow's slog like almost all the athletes running tomorrow brace is a professional runner who specialises in marathons he takes an objective long-term view of his profession as an income-earner marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations and requires business management as well as physical ability the winner of the london marathon earns a tidy dollars 50000 and the new york boston and japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category but these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape with their careers and financial prospects in mind top-level runners normally only run two marathons a year as brace says when you have only two pay-days out of 365 you choose plan and train for them with great care brace trains extremely carefully indeed 'running a marathon is the easy part' he says 'the hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performance level required' he starts training three months before an event by running 80 miles a week and then building progressively for the last six weeks he runs 120 miles a week normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off but the olympic marathon is an exception the only top-level marathon that carries no prize money brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spin-offs involved 'it does not necessarily make sense to run to win' given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money he says many runners will give less than their best effort nonetheless there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely financial italian gelindo bordin who came first in the 1988 seoul olympic marathon is a strong contender so is djibouti's ahmed salah who came third in seoul ibrahim hussein of kenya and hiromi taniguchi of japan are also possible winners none of them though will make a molehill out of the steep and formidable ascent of montjuic the financial times london page ix

this week -- the total purse of $202520 is increased by $100000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes the lineup of commercial support is impressive the race has mercedes-benz of north america as its presenting sponsor making it one of 10 companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors but have also put more money into

race gives them a foothold in their no 1 market the whole marketing approach of bill burke is great for sponsors said linda paulmeno manager of press relations for mercedes-benz the whole race is very marketing-oriented the race depends on sponsors for the bulk of its operating budget which supports a year-round full-time staff patrick said the cost to sponsors varies from the mid-six-figure range to over $1 million the fees depend on the services and products offered by a firm trade-outs are common the marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from kcop channel 13 for the television rights and the race has also been sold to cable and will be covered by radio the sponsors also work together for mutual benefit for example at&t is buying commercial time on channel 13's broadcast and channel 13 is providing updates on the at&t friendship cup an international race within the race in fact television makes the race more attractive to sponsors who figure to multiply their exposure richard lipeles president of pacificare health systems said sponsorship in the race helps separate his company in a congested health-care market also the company provides headbands to all runners

smith relatively new to long-distance running christen a new course with victories by kim q berkshire times staff writer oceanside their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish line did by the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee sunday morning benjamin paredez martinez of ecatepec mexico and kathy smith of newport beach were crowned winners in the san diego marathon at the oceanside pier efforts than earned them $2000 apiece the runs set records on the new north county course but the times even helped by warm breezes and clear 74-degree conditions were hardly blistering martinez 29 finished in 2 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds 36 seconds faster than doug kurtis of northville mich smith's 24305 seemed days quicker than the 25212 posted by escondido's mindy ireland in years past the marathon's mystery often has been who the leader was not how he got there runners often from mexico would register late and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader this year officials made sure there were no mystery men out on the course they knew who martinez was but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from alfredo rosas of san pedro going into the 25-mile mark what martinez did was start out slow and deliberate through an interpreter martinez said he started out running 515 or 520 miles rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to 10 seconds quicker per mile i knew it would kill them that they would never keep it up said martinez who won with a 518-mile pace i had to have patience and run from the back after the 14-mile mark the pack has already thinned to just rosas danny bustos doug kurtis and ernesto gutierrez who ran single file for a time martinez and martin rodriguez rivera held back but martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention the first 10-15 miles i could have been in 1000th place martinez said i didn't care then i got worried martinez left rivera and started on the chase since martinez hadn't been seen earlier it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from mile 21 to mile 24 was san diego's henry chio wrong martinez' late kick caught rosas who had broken away on his own for a three-mile lead at mile 21 cramped and been surprised at the 23-mile mark i tied up there was nothing i could do said rosas who was third in 21949 as he started closing that's when my legs really started getting sore i tried to just hang on to hang in there but he shot ahead of me before martinez took the lead for good -- a uphill surge at mile 25 -- it appeared rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him not so said rosas the police on the bikes were telling me how close he was he said it was the second marathon in two weeks that kurtis 38 has run and almost won the bangkok marathon in november was his 13th of the year his 112th to date the only recurring theme in martinez' and smith's backgrounds -- other than the 262 miles they ran -- was that they are novices at long-distance running this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers martinez is a world-class biathlete who finished third at the world duathlon championship two weeks ago near palm springs he has run only two marathons before sunday he teaches physical education in his hometown 10-15 miles outside of mexico city smith 24 was a 5000- and 10000-meter specialist at stanford but is now focusing on longer distances she is a fourth- through sixth-grade teacher at college park in irvine she was holding class with reporters long before ireland 39 was carried into a room for mandatory drug testing -- the united states olympic committee drug testing program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top finishers my goal was to come out here be as low-key as possible and try to qualify for the trials said smith who finished fourth last year and ran a personal-best time sunday she met and beat the olympic trials qualifying standard of 245 smith said she and ireland ran together -- they even chatted -- through the 20-mile mark until smith got her feet working faster than her mouth having run with ireland last year in the san diego marathon smith knew a little of ireland's racing style she's really tough in the latter part of a race smith said i wanted to hang back with her so then she could carry me through the latter part she hung in pretty well with me smith earlier this year ran the long beach marathon where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year she is getting smarter about it last year i led from miles 13 to 22 smith said this year's it's just a matter of maturity and the hills were positive for me martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his chances were good i knew rosas and kurtis were good but it was a relatively weak field he said but weak field or not the 4000-plus runners who participated in the event seemed to relish the experience as all the problems the marathon has had to deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line it's a beautiful course and this was a great marathon one runner told race director lynn flanagan i can't believe it went off so well said another to a volunteer you'd never know anything had happened that was at all an inconvenience deanna sodoma of escondido won her first marathon wheelchair race in

eng wsj870220-0106 los angeles tries to make its marathon both a civil festival and a profit center --- by frederick rose staff reporter of the wall street journal 02/20/87 wall street journal j marketing advertising mkt los angeles a crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here march 1 to run 26 miles 385 yards and cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees makers of cars soda pop sportswear copiers computers -- even a hospital -- have tagged their names to the los angeles marathon in the promoter's words this run is a marketing event on legs reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotions runners it seems are a well-heeled lot a study by mercedes-benz found that 42% of family heads making $40000 a year or more jog regularly of potential buyers showing up at mercedes dealers 47% are joggers with those numbers in mind the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons -- in new york boston and los angeles -- as well as other running races marathons have had corporate backing for some time but los angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle the city that invented the corporate-sponsored olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an olympic-type amateur race but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city i took air and made an event says william burke the founder and president of los angeles marathon inc for a man whose running days ended with his high school track team mr burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning last year its first time out the los angeles race attracted nearly 11000 runners -- four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third -- largest race in the us the event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors leaving the organizers with $370000 in red ink this year mr burke and his partner marie patrick expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even next year they say a profit is possible more than 18000 runners are expected this year an audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million coca-cola cans and 2500 billboards around the los angeles area marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors for the cost of a 30-second ad on the super bowl a company can sponsor a marathon and take over a city says lesa ukman editor of special events reports a chicago-based newsletter the los angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event los angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags milk cartons and loaves of bread in addition to soda cans billboards and other sources the venerable new york marathon is taking note the new york road runners club organizer of the race stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted now fred lebow the group's president says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the los angeles sponsors do the promotion in los angeles is unabashed we tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the los angeles market this is it says mr burke the pitch has attracted the likes of coca-cola bottling co of los angeles vons cos a large supermarket chain the los angeles times the sears savings bank unit of sears roebuck & co eastman kodak co and tandem computers inc one supporter is ellesse usa a sportswear and shoe producer a $50000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in its ads ellesse will spend an additional $100000 dressing race personnel in t-shirts and warm-up suits showing its clothes at the marathon's public expo of sponsors' wares and posting a dozen big street banners along the course the company has rented more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120000 from patrick media group a marathon sponsor the discount about 50% was important we couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally says susan cialone ellesse's advertising director ellesse which also sponsors the new york run finds the west coast event more freewheeling they have let us do whatever we want says ms cialone for instance product banners along the route -- almost impossible to arrange in new york -- are a snap in los angeles the city in fact is a partner in the race after competitive bidding it awarded an eight-year contract to los angeles marathon inc to put on the race the exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city the organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon estimated at $100000 the race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by los angeles's role as host of the 1984 olympics the logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath some posters show the los angeles coliseum with its torch and giant olympic symbol the world returns to los angeles proclaims one mercedes-benz ad race directors are called commissioners a term borrowed from the 1984 olympic organization in which mr burke was commissioner of tennis and like the olympics los angeles marathon inc portraying the race as a civic celebration thrives on volunteers some 7500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day and two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay i couldn't buy this mr burke says gesturing around the crowded race headquarters not everyone works for free big-name runners for instance want to be paid a lot and here the organizers have pinched pennies while some runners will be paid to appear this year's field like last year's lacks some of the superstars who race in boston new york and london grete waitz one of the best woman marathoners wanted $100000 to appear in los angeles she was turned down mr burke says the australian runner rob de castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but for $25000 he'd be happy to say the los angeles event was tempting mr burke says he slammed down the phone we won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners he says mr de castella's agent denies the story entirely what los angeles lacks in superstars it plans to make up for in numbers this year's race may challenge new york and london as the largest marathon ever run some 20500 started the new york race last year mr lebow organizer of the new york event says next year's los angeles marathon will surpass that number for one sponsor this may be a mixed blessing orthopaedic hospital a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign provides emergency care stations along the marathon route last year one of every 20 runners needed aid along with sprains strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia a

the 13000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on april 15 bill rodgers a four-time boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year marvels at mr kelley it's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing i'm struggling at the age of 43 this isn't golf even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of mr kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping aghast is more like it says leslie pawson 86 a three-time boston champion who ran against mr kelley half a century ago my doctor says `no running whatsoever' i can't even remember when i ran my last marathon john adelbert kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare a two-time winner in boston 1935 and 1945 and runner-up seven times mr kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year -- as he has been for 15 years mr kelley is such an institution that hopkinton mass where the race begins has made him an honorary citizen that means i don't have to pay taxes there he jokes two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6 130-pound mr kelley into boston so he won't be trampled by groupies as he calls them clamoring to shake his hand last year five japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race recalls suni tomomitsu one of the runners at first we thought `oh wow he's like mafia man' then we said `oh no this is nice johnny kelley' in japan he is awesome though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the boston marathon mr kelley is the oldest to run it peter foley who was born in 1859 was a regular until he was well into his 80s but he walked the course starting at dawn six hours before the official noon start mr foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight of course mr kelley -- not to be confused with the other john kelley who won the boston marathon in 1957 -- isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race in 2 hours 32 minutes 7 seconds his best time ever was in 1945 2 hours 30 minutes 40 seconds last year he finished in 5 hours 5 minutes he hopes to do better in 1991 that's not a prediction just a goal he says when john kelley first toed the line in 1928 george bush wasn't yet in kindergarten joe dimaggio was an unknown and nike was the winged goddess of victory not a running shoe in those days mr kelley recalls he ran in black leather high-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade i would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today he says back then the sport didn't have much of a following today of course the boston marathon is a big deal covered by tv from start to finish and offering $402000 altogether in prize money the winners get a medal and $55000 says mr kelley i got a medal and beef stew god bless them he adds they deserve it the rosy-cheeked supple mr kelley is a medical wonder each year he visits the cooper clinic at the aerobics center in dallas for a battery of endurance tests physiologically whatever that means i got all a's mr kelley reports of his checkup four months ago what that means explains kenneth cooper the physician who wrote aerobics and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes is that johnny has the body of a man 23 years younger he's going to be one of the stars of my book mr kelley's resting pulse rate -- 60 beats a minute -- is well below the average person's 72 beats that's good on the stress test the clinic gives mr kelley holds the endurance record for his age group a mechanic for boston edison co before he retired in 1972 mr kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago his only purpose was to relax and have some fun all day long i did what my boss told me to do he recalls but when i ran at night i felt free i ran till i was exhausted in 1928 when he was 21 he entered his first boston marathon but didn't finish he dropped out three-quarters of the way through the race then in 1933 he finished 37th in a field of about 200 runners in all the years since he has missed the race just once in 1967 he has competed all told in 112 marathons including the 1936 and 1948 olympics mr kelley well knows the jagged course from hopkinton to downtown boston the first challenge comes five miles into the race where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes a mile and a half later there's new reason to beware the smells of cavanaugh's bakery can set off hunger pangs an exxon station in wellesley marks the halfway point a steep descent into newton lower falls can jar a tired runner's bones then at the end of a long column of oak and maple trees is heartbreak hill his nemesis it cost him at least two victories he says and finally there's the haunted mile a stretch where many runners have collapsed boston's skyline 2 1/2 miles in the distance can seem so far away though still going strong mr kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year to compensate he trains harder he used to start preparing in earnest at the end of january in recent years i've been in training 12 months a year he says though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hour run sprints on the track and long 2 1/2-hour runs every other week -- begins in december he doesn't count the miles he puts in as many long-distance runners obsessively do but he says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles a week mr kelley always trains at 5 am and alone it's a quiet time no traffic the air is fresh and sweet his routes vary in january he prefers the frozen sands of the beach with the approach of spring he takes to the alder and scrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over cape cod bay after his morning run he spends a couple of hours painting still lifes and cape cod scenes a hobby he took up about 25 years ago unlike many runners mr kelley doesn't bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning this is my warm up i empty the dishwasher i set up the coffeepot but i don't plug it in i set up the breakfast table then i check the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear he and his wife laura live in a two-bedroom ranch-style house here in east dennis with more than 350 trophies medals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scattered about he isn't particular about brands of shoes i wear them all or what he eats i never eat broccoli but i love steak and ice cream mr kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old he's a strange man says laura kelley in awe of her husband's vigor the 82-year-old mrs kelley adds i just try to stay in his shadow but i have a hard time even doing that in a rare moment of reflection mr kelley explains what makes him tick i paint because i like it i run because i like it if for some reason i don't finish the marathon i don't owe an apology to anyone but i'll tell you

according to a biography of the slain beatle an excerpt from the book the lives of john lennon by journalist and biographer albert goldman appearing in the aug 15 issue of people magazine discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both lennon and his second wife yoko ono the book is scheduled to be published later this month by william morrow & co inc between 1976 and 1979 goldman writes lennon could not be more remote apart from a few hours in the morning and evening including time spent with his son sean lennon is back here in his room alone and silent the author says the idolized beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic starving himself to what he perceived as perfection the onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965 goldman writes when some fool described him in print as the `fat beatle' that phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed lennon rarely wore clothing other than a pair of backless slippers and avoided touching anyone according to the book the 719-page biography also details yoko ono's $5000-a-week heroin habit in 1979 she reportedly snorted the drug according to the book lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of lsd i must have taken a thousand trips the book quotes lennon as saying i just ate it all the time like candy goldman spent more than six years researching the book

yoko goldman's lennon bio `totally fiction' by larry mcshane associated press writer new york ap a biography that portrays john lennon as a drug-addled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from liverpool to new york city is totally fiction yoko ono said in a national radio broadcast it's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license i don't see john in there it's a very dramatically described something but it's not about john ono said wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by albert goldman the usually reclusive ono agreed to the interview to counter goldman's the lives of john lennon which presents the ex-beatle as a violent drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife as for ono goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of lennon's death goldman also charges she was responsible for paul mccartney's 1980 marijuana bust in japan had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as lennon ono refuted virtually all of these charges and countered through taped interviews with lennon friends and employees that goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes it's totally fiction yoko said during the hour-long program which opened with lennon's song gimme some truth and coincided with the book's national release wednesday these people in this book are not us it's not john and me ono continued it's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit back for some reason this book is attempting to rob both john and i of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to the ono interview

julian ono was interviewed by longtime associate elliot mintz who is described in goldman's book as a spy for yoko _ a charge mintz denied during the show it is for one very upsetting but most of all it is lies untruths the whole thing is just sickening said julian who also refuted goldman's tales of lennon as a violent father mintz read excerpts from the book to yoko who then responded to the allegations point by point she denied that lennon was homosexual that he was using drugs while living at the dakota with his son sean that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll howard hughes she did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s but rejected goldman's assertion that she had a $5000-a-week habit the book has already drawn angry responses from friends of lennon and ono mccartney who contradicted one anecdote involving lennon smashing a painting in paul's home has urged a boycott of the book after yoko's rebuttal listeners were invited to dial 900-digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the lennons' life results were not expected until later today goldman who conducted more than 1200 interviews for his lennon book has

digging into the lives of john lennon his first move was to mail a long reverential request for help to yoko ono she was numero uno you've got to start with her i sent her a sincere letter because at that time i was a true believer in rock's greatest love story i told her `i'm in your corner' goldman recalled ono never responded and after 1200 interviews and 6{ years the dream was over for goldman his mythic view of lennon the great altered expecting the best goldman claims to have uncovered the worst a volatile debauched lennon who evolved into the howard hughes of rock 'n' roll tucked in his dakota bed for days at a time that vision of the ex-beatle has infuriated lennon supporters family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also taught goldman _ who says he is a john lennon fan _ a hard lesson it doesn't pay to meet your idols just enjoy them don't try to see the reality goldman said my books are a cold dose of reality you get in the beatle shower and suddenly the water goes cold goldman whose past tell-all biographies dealt with elvis presley and lenny bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry from ono and from lennon's beatle buddy paul mccartney my books are bad for business goldman said in a phone interview from munich west germany they're bad for paul's business bad for yoko's business back for the jive myth of rock business those people have to hate me myth-shattering is a not a bad thing goldman said for example he cites lennon's disillusioning meeting with presley at graceland in 1965 john was very hooked into elvis elvis was his measure of success said goldman and the myth of elvis awesome but the reality of elvis a mess goldman also rejected the complaint raised by ono mccartney julian lennon and others that lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations you can't say john lacks for defenders and yoko isn't dead colonel parker presley's manager isn't dead ninety-five percent of the people in my books aren't dead they can do something about it said goldman his voice quickening this business of making it easy for defending myself is insane i'm the target of scores of attacks i can't imagine a harder thing for an author those attacks don't really bother him unless they come from someone who hasn't read the lives of john lennon goldman said a lot of people already made up their minds they hear albert goldman john lennon homosexuality _ bang let him have it i resent people commenting on a book they haven't read including yoko the author said ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the book she labeled goldman's version of life with the lennons totally fiction and brought out lennon's sons julian and 12-year-old sean to refute the biography these giant promotions of yoko are presented as honest documentaries when they're in-house documentaries said goldman who complimented ono on a well-prepared show she takes no chances this was another no-chance yoko as for the sensational charges of bisexuality drug abuse by yoko and john wild drinking binges anorexia and reclusiveness goldman says it all fits together with the image of lennon presented by those who knew him my thesis is john lennon was a divided mind every yin had a yang said goldman there is nothing more natural than for john to try the other side sexually

watch it to the end is because i'm responsible for it even though somebody else made it she said cassettes film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by ono she also took cassettes of interviews by lennon which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture andrew solt this is elvis directed solt and david l wolper produced and solt and sam egan wrote it i think this is really the definitive documentary of john lennon's life ono said in an interview what john was really about is depicted in this film very accurately and without whitewashing i did view it i didn't have them take any footage out i wanted the truth in the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half balance is a very serious consideration i think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so there is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by lennon tied in with the film and using the same title imagine there's no heaven it's easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today imagine is more than a lennon elegy though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of lennon and the

antagonistic toward the lennons during their bed-in when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace we were naive ono said a lot of things happened because we were naive maybe that was our strength to us al capp was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal with a sense of humor we didn't expect hostility al capp is one incident that was filmed in those days we did numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace there were some very rough interviews the hostility that was shown to us bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible each time i think we were hurt ono said lennon wrote the song imagine in 1969 or '70 we did the bed-in the toronto peace festival the `war's over' billboard he was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace i think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds imagine there's no countries it isn't hard to do nothing to kill or die for and no religion

killed outside his manhattan apartment on dec 8 1980 ono was a painter when lennon met her she later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace i think that for somebody like me because i feel that i'm an artist and a creative artist that it is a very strange turn of events that i'm known as a widow she said but it is stranger to me that i'm not that disturbed by it i think that john promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him i think it is my turn to promote him he promoted me when albert goldman's the lives of john lennon was published in september depicting the former beatle as riddled with vices faults and neuroses ono called it totally fiction since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans i was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time very warmly i really appreciate that

is the public image of young john lennon baird's half-brother and giuliano's idol but the neglected urchin and his live-it-up mother _ who was also baird's mother _ never existed the authors say that woman laughing singing dancing saying goodbye to john and john standing there alone crying `mummy mummy' that's not my brother that's not my mother that's not my children's grandmother said baird who recently spent three weeks in the united states promoting her book a family portrait of lennon and his liverpool roots published in north america last fall john lennon my brother was co-authored by giuliano a beatles aficionado who lives in this erie canal city about 25 miles north of buffalo the two-year cross-atlantic collaboration came from two different motives giuliano wanted to do a book about lennon baird wanted to do a book about the ex-beatle's maligned mother whose name also was julia the result is a little of both a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and julia turned her son over to her sister mimi lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother i didn't do it for john said baird i wanted to set the record straight about our mother and that ties in with john i feel my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press baird a 41-year-old teacher in cheshire england was born seven years after lennon to julia and her common-law second husband john dykins she and her younger sister jacqui grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts uncles cousins _ and big brother john the book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teen-agers lennon paul mccartney and george harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with julia it tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date who between songs at a beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the dykins girls out of the front row away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage but mostly it tells of a mother and son who while living apart had a loving relationship the book got its start after baird watched a british television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of lennon's murder the show presented julia as an unfit mother no mother at all baird said baird complained and was urged to tell her story she wrote an essay and arranged to publish it in liverpool then she met giuliano who was in liverpool to promote his first book the beatles a celebration giuliano 35 a self-proclaimed huckster convinced baird to work with him on a book which he pieced together from interviews with baird in england while proofreading the text baird sent a copy to mccartney he sent his blessing plus a bonus a brief foreword for the book with a collection of rare early photos the book is more a family album than a biography giuliano's text reads like oral history as if a british schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the reader's knees to boast about her brother the musician however the book is a narrow view of lennon a child's recollections of an aspiring brother after julia was killed in a traffic accident in 1958 baird saw less and less of lennon losing contact with him for years when he and wife yoko ono moved to the united states the end of the book describes what baird calls lennon's desire to regain his lost liverpool roots when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80 baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but insists she just wants to tell the family's story of lennon's early years i could have cashed in when john was alive baird said when john died the tabloids in england were knocking on the door saying `write your story name your price' we quickly showed them the door also shown the door was albert goldman whose sordid biography the lives of john lennon hit bookstores about the same time as baird's book baird who read goldman's scathing biography of elvis presley said she turned down an interview with goldman who brands lennon homosexual anorexic and possibly a murderer i had heard goldman was doing the book six years ago and i knew what the tone would be baird said most people including goldman write books based on other books that have it all wrong giuliano was harsher goldman was in it for the money from day one giuliano said goldman knows the formula the more sleaze the more dough so what's his motive if he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most dough baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing she agreed to change the title from my brother john to john lennon my brother the cover's look-alike photos of baird and lennon in granny specs also help but she said she didn't don them to sell books they're on the national health britain's medical plan and she and lennon inherited their mother's short-sightedness baird said the book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a brother whose art touched millions it's not a major biography giuliano said this book is a little slice out of a big pie out of a big life it offers a lot of previously unknown details on lennon's early life it's a sympathetic view sure but

drummer andy newmark was touring with roxy music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life he was to play on john lennon's new album lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking care of his son sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas but in 1980 he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife yoko ono it was more than a superstar session afterall lennon gave no press conferences and didn't attend clubs or concerts rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one lennon jokingly referred to himself as greta hughes and howard garbo producer jack douglas who had worked with lennon as an engineer recruited newmark bassist tony levin guitarist hugh mccracken and other new york-based sessions players recording was to take place at the hit factory in manhattan to newmark lennon was a hero and only a hero he didn't know him and was nervous about working with him the drummer guessed he was something like the intense irreverent young man of the movies help and a hard day's night lennon was those things - and more his personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about john lennon said newmark who still lives in new york and works with former roxy music singer bryan ferry his straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the stories and images we had created i didn't see anything that seemed startlingly new to the myth it just appeared to be what we had imagined down to earth direct so direct it could not offend people newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs that eventually ended up on double fantasy and milk and honey lennon's final albums it was the best experience of my life he insisted the highlight of my career the nerves quickly settled once recording began lennon was just a working musician with the same goal as everyone else finishing the album the music was mostly mainstream pop no 18-minute jams or political anthems i hate all that fancy stuff lennon told his drummer keep it simple like ringo he was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher sweeter than on earlier albums lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience and the songs were melodic the production lush dear yoko and grow old with me were tributes to his wife beautiful boy darling boy was for sean lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on watching the wheels and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on borrowed time capping the line good to be older with a self-assured you bet between takes lennon jammed on buddy holly songs and played host sushi was the food of choice the strongest drug was brazilian coffee freshly ground guys i'm taking off lennon would say as he poured himself another cup and there were plenty of stories about the beatles - the b's as john called them reunions were out of the question a return to adolescence in his opinion but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high by this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it newmark said when he talked about the `b's' it was as if it was his band he was the spiritual leader i felt that a lot through the sessions by the fall newmark had finished working on the album and his contact with lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio but he had planned on working with him again milk and honey was to come out the following year and lennon wanted to tour using many of the same musicians life is what happens when you're busy making other plans lennon once sang it took the drummer a long time to recover from lennon's murder the night of dec 8 1980 he didn't even feel like working for the next few years - everything else suddenly seemed second rate newmark never listens to the record but still hears woman on the radio when he thinks about it now it's not so much a particular song that hurts him it's the day-to-day stuff the jokes and wisecracks the coffee and the stories no one had a reason to remember all that at the time those weren't supposed to be farewell sessions when i looked in his eyes i felt a tremendous depth of character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition a tremendous amount of compassion newmark said he was totally friendly and open to everybody including the janitor he had time for everybody that working class hero thing he was trying to be real about that end adv sunday nov 25 ap901208-0076 ap-ny-12-08-90 1311est r i am-lennonanniversary 12-08 0343 am-lennon anniversary0424 crowds in

in an interview with sky satellitetelevision news ten years on it's a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent seven hours with somebody you have been a fan of for years and i think i left thinking `this is great he's in really good shape' peebles said late in 1980 that lennon had just recovered from a period when he had gone off the rails and his relationship with ms ono had suffered but when i

there's the whitney museum of art which exhibited ono's artwork last year -- one of the 10 museum shows she has had around the world there's also the american film institute which ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films and ono's record label -- they want to put out all my songs in a kind of cd box or something ono says surprised so's ono she's used to rougher treatment acceptance is a difficult concept for her i'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it ono says during a telephone interview she's speaking from the new york office of bag one arts the company ono founded to promote lennon's art and image marketing an icon since his death in 1980 ono has steadily kept lennon products coming out the albums milk and honey and menlove avenue and the 4-cd boxed set the john lennon collection the book skywriting by word of mouth a collection of lennon's unpublished writings lennon's art which ono says was his main interest in his final years and lennon-inspired merchandise such as a line of john lennon eyeglasses i told the fans that i'm going to do 10 years of it every year hopefully give a new product and share it with the fans ono says some years we had two or three products of john that came out the 10-year promise ended with last year's year-long celebration of lennon's 50th birthday in 1991 ono says she has tried to relax a little and do my own stuff ono 57 has been going into a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music she continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in iceland ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist then went avant-garde she began doing performance art in the early '60s long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants a life in two worlds ono declines to put a label on her current works she says that's for the critics to decide i just like to create she says ono

mark david chapman shot him five times with a 38 revolver after lennon's death there was speculation that ono would leave the united states forever she did begin living part-time in geneva my theory was that i would live more and more in geneva ono says but it seems like circumstances are making me come back more and more to new york this is my hometown that's how i feel about it it's a place where i can work very well ono was born in tokyo -- her name means ocean child -- and came with her family to the united states in 1936 ono lived with her family in san francisco and new york until the japanese attack of pearl harbor forced them to return home in 1951 the onos returned to new york yoko married a japanese composer when she was 23 the marriage lasted seven years ono married a second time in 1963 to avant-garde artist tony cox the couple had one child a daughter named kyoko in 1966 ono and lennon met he too was married and had a child julian ono and lennon were married in 1970 there has been much speculation on ono and lennon's relationship some say she controlled him john was an extremely strong person ono says there was no way to dominate him even if i wanted to others say lennon used his relationship with ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him -- such as the beatles in may 1968 when the beatles came together at the studio to work on the beatles the two-record set commonly called the white album ono was at lennon's side the two were inseparable according to at least one beatles biographer ono even accompanied lennon on trips to the bathroom the relationship between the beatles -- especially lennon and paul mccartney -- was already strained having ono in the studio offering suggestions and backing lennon up in arguments didn't help still the group already seemed headed toward a break-up which finally came when mccartney sued the other beatles to resolve an argument over the group's management so no ono didn't break up the beatles but it's also true that three of them didn't like her much life after john i think the very fact that john and i got together hurt them a lot she says it's 50/50 we hurt them and they hurt us i can't really say it's a one-sided situation ono says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving beatles songwriters in this world are pretty harmless people she says they're not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed they're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire people i have a lot of respect for them but how do the beatles feel toward ono these days it varies she says sometimes they are friendly sometimes they are not like all relationships with friends i think that's natural many of the books that have been written about lennon and the beatles especially albert goldman's loathing portrait of lennon have been painful to ono but she says she isn't sure about writing her own version i was hurt very much and my son too by some of the things that were written she says they were lies and that's what hurt us then again when i think of writing my true story i could say 'this is the truth' and write about things somebody did or whatever but then i think about their children if you look at it from the big picture maybe there was not such an incredible crime done to me doug mason

but you've got to hand it to him this guy is one ambitious sleazemonger most best-selling pop biographers play it safe they choose a celeb of respectable not to say pristine reputation and then they proceed to blacken it preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess chemical dependency personal unkindness raw business dealings even in some cases dyslexia the resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions a can't-miss formula surely albert goldman's previous victim in the genre was elvis presley now mr presley was if you'll forgive the expression a fat target for a writer of mr goldman's methods his title notwithstanding the king of rock 'n' roll was in truth more a creature of the old show biz a star whose wholesome image carefully created by pr wizards was ripe for debunking but in choosing mr lennon as his next target mr goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable for apart from his puerile politics mr lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history his voracious drug use his perfidy to employees his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on by his own accounting then mr lennon was not about to dethrone ward cleaver as the all-american dad his public loved him in spite of it all -- or perhaps because of it all mr lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery quaint terms were losing their social sting his candor -- if that's what it was and not simple logorrhea -- redeemed everything and so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful mr goldman hot to debunk attacks his subject the leitmotif of mr lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him and that with yoko ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity now mr goldman is here to announce he didn't tell you the half of it hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness percolating with the scoops that have by now been widely publicized in people magazine west 57th and other scholarly venues that mr lennon had a thing for young boys that his marriage to ms ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit the squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak sliming up every page remarkably then the sleazemonger's art has triumphed mr goldman's john lennon is even worse than john lennon's john lennon a great deal of this muck manages to splash onto ms ono whom mr goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting mr lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth mr goldman alas allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well the keepers of the lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out ms ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds and rolling stone magazine long the house organ for the lennon publicity machine recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic criticizing the lives of john lennon for insufficient respect to the fallen beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning charles manson for his bad table manners the book may indeed be inaccurate as critics have charged but one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate mr goldman's book there is for starters the sloppy pompous prose so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge -- mr goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as pieces as though they were concerti there is his knowing hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drugs sex music -- that gives him license to second-guess mr lennon's every move and there is the awkward organization in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on mr lennon while major events are skipped over lightly because -- there goes the advance -- they might reveal mr lennon in a flattering light all of which indicates why the lives of john lennon is such a wretched book not because it makes a good man look bad but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one we laymen will probably never know -- look bad john lennon while he was alive did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites --- mr ferguson is assistant managing

gorbachev a lifelong creature of the kgb hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other the coup falls apart and gorbachev triumphantly returns

that right-wing officials had started embryonic plans for a coup the officials said front us intelligence told bush of signs of impending coup the coup's aftermath as soon as the hard-liners made their move sunday night -- two days before gorbachev was to sign the treaty -- it was obvious the coup was doomed to failure they said one result of the bungled coup is that soviet president mikhail gorbachev -- even though reinstated as head of state -- could be irrelevant to what happens next analysts said even before gorbachev returned to moscow they predicted his future would be limited to a figurehead role he lost by being peripheral to what happened no one really came to gorbachev's assistance as leader of the country one us official said instead opposition to the coup was based on the illegality of the principle of usurping power and widespread fear that if gorbachev could be rolled up then other democratically elected leaders could be too in the aftermath of the coup analysts also

important has happened in soviet politics since 1917 when the bolsheviks seized power in moscow on wednesday the system the bolsheviks and joseph stalin created finally collapsed a new historical

resisting this putsch announced the arrival of a nation capable of self-governance front defiant soviets have won power to rule themselves analysis the coup people as president bush dubbed them could not have miscalculated more profoundly they thought the issue was mikhail gorbachev and apparently believed that by neutralizing gorbachev and threatening everyone else they could quickly take charge of the country but the people of the soviet union apparently concluded that the real issue was not gorbachev himself but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created for the first time in their thousand-year history russians asserted their independence from autocracy and the autocrats fell there will be much to sort out in the months ahead but almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke that revolution will alter the country creating a new decentralized and probably smaller soviet union much more quickly than anyone anticipated gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these events it seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century but this week he was trumped by boris yeltsin who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him yeltsin had two talents that gorbachev lacked one was the ability to stay close to the russian people as their world was transformed by gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in russia and gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the soviet communist party the world from which both he and gorbachev emerged gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as yeltsin has he surrounded himself with traditional communist party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas gorbachev thought vladimir kryuchkov of the kgb boris pugo of the ministry of interior dmitri yazov of the red army and gennady yanayev of the communist party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms instead they turned out to be mortal enemies if they had been only personal enemies gorbachev might have been undone by them but when they closed the new liberal news media and reverted to the stalinist tradition of the big lie the members of the state emergency committee threatened not just gorbachev but also the new soviet union -- a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity self-reliance and freedom for years soviets and western kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new soviet union were irreversible tuesday it became clear that they were of course gorbachev initiated those changes and history will credit him for that he also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend it is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state could not in their moment of truth behave like thugs and kill their compatriots they left gorbachev alive and yeltsin at large they let the western media report their coup as it unfolded and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country even their own news media under strict control conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup by tuesday night the emergency committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of yeltsin and this proved an unequal contest as gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with yeltsin over a new union treaty the legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that yeltsin received in the elections for president of the russian federation was a formidable political force at first blush the botching of the coup was surprising -- couldn't the vaunted kgb and its allies run an efficient putsch but these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn

despair in his voice i must say this has been a great drama for me a severe trial retribution for yeltsin yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution it had been gorbachev who ordered yeltsin out of a hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the moscow communist party committee at that session one speaker after another attacked yeltsin for political immaturity and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its politburo and it was gorbachev in 1990 who came to the russian parliament to call on deputies to vote against yeltsin as their chairman although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new union treaty it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of soviet politics gorbachev said he and yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an emergency if one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders like what happened now his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other gorbachev said it appeared that the move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with legislative consent soviet law makes the vice president the next-in-line gennady yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring gorbachev physically incapacitated the conspirators themselves are now in jail and facing interrogation gorbachev said the leaders of the junta tried to turn us all into chopped meat and they should be prosecuted without hesitation or forgiveness soviet prime minister valetin pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup soviet and russian television reported today pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted gorbachev from power but he was reportedly taken ill on sunday night when the coup began he has been under police guard in a hospital since gorbachev regained power wednesday speculation of guilt also turned on another key figure in the old gorbachev government according to yeltsin supreme soviet chairman

stuff of a byzantine cold war novel enticing enough to grab the attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist did mikhail gorbachev orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him the blueprint for imposing a state of emergency was drawn by gorbachev himself last winter he pushed through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of freedom of the press he hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions and other key officials who took part in the coup perspective was gorbachev the mastermind behind the coup a perspective special section eugene b rumer a specialist in soviet affairs wrote this article for the los angeles times times reporter cathleen decker contributed gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power some warnings came from gorbachev's liberal advisers such as alexander yakovlev shortly before the coup but incredibly the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves a leading conservative journalist alexander prokhanov known as the nightingale of the general staff published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the general staff academy the commander-in-chief of the soviet navy and gorbachev's deputy at the defense council oleg baklanov with remarkable candor baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union needless to say baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the gang of eight gorbachev ignored these warnings to some -- an admitted minority -- the thought of a gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional soviet art of deception known as maskirovka and to laymen something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power the most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from gorbachev himself in his thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the crimea among the questions if gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal to him throughout why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate gorbachev's guards or at least separate them from him if gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators down to his view of their trembling hands it is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to gorbachev on their part a more plausible scenario is that gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy which with his participation could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new union treaty to have been signed last tuesday which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics it is possible that unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence gorbachev did reveal however that two important officials had visited him in crimea at the outset of the coup one was head of the kgb department responsible for the security of soviet leaders the other was v boldin gorbachev's closest aide by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him one can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise conspiracy theorists grope for motives -- gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers but there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power

television miss ball insisted that arnaz be her co-star but the network wasn't sure that arnaz would be a hit with the american public the couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved that audiences would sit still to watch a leggy blue-eyed comedian and a cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent cbs relented and her antics became comedy classics lucy putting too much yeast in the

lucille ball dies tv's comic genius was 77 death caused by ruptured abdominal aorta as she appeared to be recovering from surgery by roxane arnold times staff writer lucille ball the leggy showgirl model and b-grade movie queen whose pumpkin hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television died early wednesday a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery the co-creator and star of i love lucy a product of tv's golden age that continues via syndication to be viewed by millions around the world was 77 and died at cedars-sinai medical center of a ruptured abdominal aorta known simply as lucy to four decades of smitten television fans she had undergone surgery at cedars-sinai on april 18 to replace part of her aorta and aortic valve and had recovered from the 6 1/2-hour operation to a point where she was eating and even walking around her hospital room hospital spokesman ronald wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta the main heart artery far from where the operation was performed she suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless wise said there was nothing to indicate this would happen wise said the heart itself apparently was not involved in miss ball's sudden death since last week's surgery fans had flooded the hospital with thousands of get-well cards sent via telegram and even facsimile machine hospital officials said it was the largest outpouring they had ever seen miss ball was a tough-talking woman who had used her stardom and show business savvy to become with her then-husband the late desi arnaz head of one of hollywood's major studios desilu despite her business acumen she remained the unquestioned queen of television comedy from her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and '40s to the television career that made her a legend miss ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches almost humbly she liked to say she owed her enormous success not so much to talent but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players her greatest achievements she always would add were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children lucie in 1951 and desi jr two years later i am not funny ball told an interviewer for rolling stone magazine in 1983 my writers were funny my directors were funny the situations were funny what i am is brave i have never been scared not when i did movies certainly not when i was a model and not when i did i love lucy it was i love lucy which premiered on cbs on oct 15 1951 that earned miss ball her niche in television history the 30-minute comedy starred miss ball and the cuban-born arnaz as the wacky lucy ricardo and her conga-playing husband ricky the show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time -- of almost any time stopped the nation in creating the show miss ball and arnaz -- who died in 1986 -- set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come they filmed the programs in front of a live audience and in doing so invented the popular and financially rewarding rerun the show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation every monday night from 9 pm to 930 pm in fact nighttime shoppers became so scarce in chicago that the mammoth marshall field department store posted a sign that read we love lucy too so from now on we will be open thursday night instead of monday when presidential candidate adlai e stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message he was flooded with angry mail even a charge that miss ball was a communist made by the house un-american activities committee in 1952 failed to dent her popularity the charges based on her registering to vote as a communist in 1936 were dropped when miss ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather millions of sympathetic fans and a pragmatic cbs understood a phenomenal 40 million viewers watched the antics each week as lucy would always try to outwit ricky with their best friends and landlords fred and ethel mertz played by veterans william frawley and vivian vance as the perfect foils the ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were rowdy and always ridiculous a generation of americans grew to recap their favorite lucy episodes plot twist by crazy twist there was the time lucy schemed her way onto ricky's television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf and there was the time lucy and ethel trying to impress their new york friends with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to hollywood pried loose the cement block containing john wayne's footprints from in front of grauman's chinese theater of course the block broke week after week lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch locked in a meat freezer or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head her turmoils permanently positioned her in the hearts of most americans including the critics an extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give 'i love lucy' an engaging lilt wrote new york times critic jack gould in its lucy cover story time magazine said this is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that has been rare lucille submits enthusiastically to being hit with pies falls over furniture tricked out as a ballerina or a hindu maharani or a toothless hillbilly she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging zest and good humor in a 1981 interview in the times even miss ball admitted i love lucy there were two key qualities to her the comedienne said she was always in financial trouble -- if she wanted a fur collar a ratty little fur collar she had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it god that's universal and she always had a domineering figure over her lucy was forever knocking somebody's top hat off miss ball's personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with desi jr an amazing 44 million viewers 90% of the television audience gleefully watched on jan 19 1953 when she gave birth on film to the show's little ricky to the unabashed delight of a nation it was the same night she had given birth in real life i was so damned happy -- just floating on a cloud -- and i think the way i felt came across on the film she said i loved doing all those pregnant shows astoundingly or so it seems in retrospect early reviews of miss ball's talents gave little hint of what was to come in fact when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on broadway miss ball was told by a drama teacher to give up luckily the turquoise-eyed teen-ager ignored the advice born to an electrician father and pianist mother on aug 6 1911 in a suburb of jamestown ny miss ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first by 5 the brown-haired little girl was taking music lessons each spring that followed she would head toward new york city walking until someone found her and returned her to her home leaving school at 15 miss ball finally made it to new york and the john murray anderson dramatic school there was a brief stint in a ziegfeld follies road show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of broadway chorus lines changing her name to diane belmont i always loved the name diane and i was driving past the belmont race track and the names seemed to fit together she turned to modeling at various times a dress model and a hat model miss ball with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack ultimately became a chesterfield girl america grew to know her on billboards magazine ads and on posters in its drugstore windows then in 1933 she headed to hollywood her curly hair bleached a jean harlow platinum miss ball was hired to work for six weeks in the chorus of samuel goldwyn's roman scandals bit part after bit part stretched her stay to six months and she became a hollywood fixture taking second billing in the years that followed to everyone from the three stooges and buster keaton to katharine hepburn and spencer tracy along the way she dyed her hair a fiery red and was given the unofficial title of queen of the bs reviewers noted her pert presence and talent for rubber-faced slapstick clowning she was described in one newspaper as a slangy breezy wisecracking gal with a bebop rhythm to her walk said another pretty lucille ball was born for the parts ginger rogers sweats over playing the ingenue lead in the 1940 musical too many girls miss ball met rumba singer arnaz cast as a cuban football player she later told an interviewer it was at least for me true love from the start exchanging vows seven months later the pair began what was for the most part a troubled marriage all but three of their first 11 years of marriage were spent apart with arnaz traveling the country with his band and miss ball committed to hollywood sound stages the pair spent almost $30000 on telegrams and long-distance telephone calls we would end up talking on the phone -- no fighting on the phone miss ball told interviewers you can't have a marriage over the phone you can't have children over the phone it became obvious that something had to be done what was done to salvage the marriage was i love lucy since cbs was stubbornly opposed to the idea of the heavily accented arnaz playing the husband the determined arnazes created their own desilu company and took a stage version of their show on the road to gauge public opinion it was a smash and television executives reluctantly gave i love lucy a time slot i wanted our characters to have problems miss ball said of her concept for the show i wanted to be an average housewife a very nosy but very average housewife and i wanted my husband to love me cbs thought we were out of our minds to want to do it on film the episodes were filmed before a live audience by academy award-winning cinematographer karl freund famous for his work on such films as the good earth and garbo's camille when the arnazes negotiated to keep the films to show our kids someday few in the industry predicted what would happen i remember someone saying 'these films may be worth something someday' miss ball told the times you should hang onto them if desi had that in mind i never knew it maybe he knew he was creating the rerun but he never told me about it all i knew was i was 40 years old and was having my first baby and i didn't want to do these shows and let them disappear into the air i felt we could save the films for home movies instead in the years since the original 153 i love lucy episodes were telecast they have been shown and reshown in virtually every country around the globe earning an estimated $50 million to $100 million miss ball's face was one of the most recognized on earth but all of it was not enough to save her troubled marriage to the horror of their television fans miss ball and arnaz were divorced in 1960 he arnaz was like jekyll and hyde she said years later he drank and he gambled and he went around with other women it was always the same booze and broads breaking with the past miss ball left hollywood for new york and a starring role in the musical wildcat the 1960 production floundered after only a few performances but during her stay in the east she met stand-up comedian gary morton they married in 1961 meanwhile arnaz and miss ball had sold their i love lucy films to cbs for $6 million and she bought her ex-husband's interest in desilu becoming in effect the first woman to head a major studio it was by then home to 18 shows including such hits as the untouchables and the ann sothern show friend bob hope called her business sense startling i never wanted to be an executive but when my marriage to desi broke up after 19 years i couldn't just walk away from my obligations and say 'forget it' miss ball explained we were an institution life takes guts if you don't take chances you'll never bathe again because you might get dirty again husband morton said miss ball was blessed with an innate business sense when she was running desilu he said she made decisions affecting the future of the company that often amazed board members not because they were coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be correct among the shows miss ball tutored to success was her own the lucy show a series without arnaz but with the same madcap clowning that kept her fans delighted among the guest stars attracted by the madness were elizabeth taylor and richard burton the most glittering couple of the day in 1967 with desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits star trek and mission impossible among them an exhausted miss ball decided that she had had enough gulf & western industries bought the property for a reported $17 million in place of desilu miss ball along with morton launched the much smaller lucille ball productions inc and in 1968 began filming here's lucy a series featuring desi jr and lucie my life started when my children were born miss ball said at the time i couldn't wait to work with them even when they moved out of the house they were still home at the studio i liked that the series aired through 1974 with her children's careers off the launching pad the comedienne then 63 decided it was time to retire her legendary character the lucy character is too old to run around like an idiot she said in explanation that same year she filmed her final motion picture mame a version of the broadway musical although by now the world's best-known television star as a movie star miss ball again received mixed reviews times critic charles champlin wrote the shame about 'mame' is that it managed to deny us a lucy to love with those final starring credits to her name she settled into co-producing shows making occasional television appearances and accepting one after another of a continual barrage of awards and tributes in addition to her 13 emmy nominations she won four miss ball was feted in 1976 with a nostalgic television tribute saluting the 25th anniversary of i love lucy danny kaye was among those who gave testimonials during the two hours of reminiscing calling lucille ball just a comedienne is like calling margot fonteyn just a dancer kaye said in 1984 when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the television hall of fame she credited the many talented and creative people around her for making her a legend i have been absolutely blessed miss ball said role as bag lady the following year she took on one of the most challenging roles of her career a bag lady in the television movie stone pillow she was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over but it was a critical and ratings success her last flirtation with television came with her ill-fated and short-lived 1986 series life with lucy in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick gale gordon it was quickly pulled by the network because of abysmal ratings her final public appearance proved to be during the 61st annual academy awards ceremony on march 29 when she joined her old friend hope as a presenter she had signed a contract with putnam to publish her autobiography but died before she could begin work on it tearfully sentimental when it came to her husband and family she reveled in life as a grandmother and glowed whenever she talked of her children their struggles and early failed marriages seemed not to matter while she always spoke fondly of arnaz miss ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in morton he morton takes care of me like i was his mother she told an interviewer in 1981 gary gives me protection on a scale of 1 to 10 miss ball said i rate my marriage to gary a 12 but to her countless television fans -- from the postwar babies who adored her during the '50s to their children and children's children who roared at her antics through decades of reruns -- it was always lucy and ricky more than a quarter-century of marriage to morton could not erase that there was always the hilarious image of the redhead and that cuban bongo player as miss ball affectionately called him even years after the lucy shows ended the comedienne openly admitted to missing the characterization after lucy ended i thought 'i'll live a few more years and then i'll die she said in 1983 i didn't plan on living this long now i miss her related stories page 3 and calendar page 1

ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever and then there were those at cedars-sinai medical center where she died they had admired her as a celebrity for

times arts editor lucille ball whose death wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory was the movies' greatest gift to television it turned out to be one of sam goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his goldwyn girls to appear in roman scandals with eddie cantor in 1933 she had had bit parts in two earlier films but roman scandals was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a hollywood career the movies prepared her for television she perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films including three of fred astaire's and one of the marx brothers room service a lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film history but in those years lucy was refining her enduring endearing public image as a perky saucy woman who was likelier at least in the early days to end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself yet as often happened with supporting performers her verve an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the square-cut principals and led to leading roles to look at the i love lucy reruns today as everybody does again and again is to realize how superbly professional they are today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique shooting in front of live audiences that desi arnaz pioneered the idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne she made it all -- even the wildest craziest capers -- look as if it were happening now -- spontaneous unrehearsed accidental the inevitable consequences of the screen lucy's scatterbrained and lovable personality her foils -- desi himself vivian vance and william frawley -- were superb farceurs themselves but lucy was the dynamo that made it all work the craft was invisible the skills so perfected they concealed themselves totally it was a brilliant illusion generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing the result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in television's history thus far the appeal of the lucy shows was also the most universal that american television has yet provided they were wholly prototypically american and that is central to their popularity abroad yet they have been embraced as the kind of middle-class goings-on that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class lucy was all-american but equally a citizen of the world her successful career in films in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status gave her an invaluable identification when i love lucy began the irony is that created by the movies she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies indeed when lucy began to commandeer our hearts on i love lucy in 1951 the movies were already in considerable trouble their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of lucy in their living rooms as always her timing was impeccable lucille ball was not lucy of course she had come a hard road from jamestown ny in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained she was smart hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was comedy was not accidental then again the cameras television or film have x-ray properties and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing photo the

gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100000 gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring iraq and against internal opposition they have been very late in assisting the people he said sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting flag-waving rally participants who also carried signs criticizing their native country planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake but part of the friday's activities focused on iran's stricken residents gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life this regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery this regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with iraq and to oppression of the people at home he said a un-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight years of the iran-iraq war iran's islamic republic was established in 1979 after shah mohammad reza pahlavi was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and militants seized the us embassy in tehran taking 66 americans hostage the united states

press writer moscow ap mikhail s gorbachev on friday proposed tougher legislation to punish soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms the soviet leader told a meeting of the communist party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups perestroika or restructuring is gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change state-run media also indicated friday that a crackdown had begun on people in armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of azerbaijan the six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the nagorno-karabakh district has led to mass rallies strikes and ethnic violence since february the supreme soviet presidium the government's top executive body intervened july 18 it rejected any change in nagorno-karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the region's economy and culture the conflict over nagorno-karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by gorbachev since he became communist party chief in march 1985 he indicated friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the central committee the party's policy-making body a summary of his remarks was distributed by the official tass news agency gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the soviet union tass said among the causes gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups tass said that after gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces he suggested increasing accountability in soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife tass did not give details of gorbachev's suggestion at the july 18 presidium meeting the soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the nagorno-karabakh annexation drive gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from article 36 of the 1977 soviet constitution which says the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness hostility or contempt tass said gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the soviet union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions in particular the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs the labor newspaper trud said 44 people in yerevan armenia's capital will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of nagorno-karabakh attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city the paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration but said 155 drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined in its july 18th decision the presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the caucasus mountain region tass reported friday that the situation was stabilizing in armenia but said that at the urging of instigators some strikes and protests were continuing ap891213-0164 ap-nr-12-13-89 1711est u i am-soviet-germans 12-13 0536

tatars who were expelled from their homelands by josef stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years tass reported wednesday the ice has been broken a start has been made we're working on creating such autonomy said rafik nishanov chairman of a chamber of the soviet legislature in remarks carried by the official news agency however he said the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still had to be worked out for example a 10-year program on resettlement people can't just be expelled from the area for others to move in the tatars of the crimea and the ethnic germans who lived on the volga river were forcibly resettled during world war ii when josef stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas the tatars and germans among others long have been agitating to return from siberia and central asia to their traditional lands and last month the supreme soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated but other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple the supreme soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on nov 28 but kept it quiet apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions it was also a potentially dangerous precedent the soviet union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups and many of them have outstanding territorial claims trouble already has been reported between ethnic germans and russians in several cities on the volga residents of the saratov and volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the

sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with romania - calling moldovan a separate language from romanian and constructing a separate history for the moldovan people industry was

official language and to calls for renewed union with romania with strikes and demonstrations and finally last year proclaiming trans dnestr independent under a russian president mr igor smirnov during the august coup last year the moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the trans dnestr authorities welcomed it siding with the soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule

conflict in the former yugoslavia and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former soviet union the problem is indeed a pressing one the disputes in the transcaucasus central asia and elsewhere in the former soviet union are causing great suffering for those involved they are a source of legitimate concern to the russians who are worried by clashes close to their borders they are concerned too about the safety of ethnic russians living in those countries where there are conflicts and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to russia whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m they believe that the problems in some of the former soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood the russians fear that if they do nothing the conflicts will worsen and probably spread they argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security they ask why when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them equally these disputes are of legitimate concern to britain its western partners and the whole international community both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability if uncontrolled they pose a variety of threats to european security including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism crises in russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate russia's relations with the west unless they are carefully handled they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us the west is sometimes suspicious of moscow's attitude there are no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts but there are differences over how to go about it the british government will not underwrite russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces nor are countries that secured their independence when the soviet union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to moscow the same role it played in the soviet empire they fear that this would compromise their sovereignty when they are willing for russian troops to play a peacekeeping role they want there to be some form of international monitoring this has meant that even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots it has been wary of appearing to endorse russian involvement instead in case it had imperial tendencies if we are to fashion a joint approach by russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former soviet union we must address all these concerns clearly russia has an important role to play in this area if the russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community the west in turn needs guarantees that russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former soviet union peace-keeping in the former soviet union as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere must comply with internationally recognised principles it needs to be looked at on a case by case basis respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount we agreed that the principles underlying russian cis or international peacekeeping operations would need to include strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict commitment to a parallel political peace process a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces which should whenever possible be multinational in character and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed these principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict focus attention and where possible resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former soviet union all this will help enhance russian peacekeeping practices although the conference for security and co-operation in europe and the un lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process extending co-operation within the north atlantic co-operation council and also co-operation between russia and nato might help improve training for russian peacekeepers this is an area we shall need to explore further we also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy one of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former soviet union the csce and other international institutions can play an important role here drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles we discussed ways of strengthening the csce's role including the role of the high commissioner for national minorities at the recent rome ministerial meeting we must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they erupt into conflict it will not be easy but we must try potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions we need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership and we need to deal with it urgently our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all the authors are uk foreign secretary

president mikhail s gorbachev warned the nation saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the soviet union apart as president gorbachev said it is his duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society for every family and for every person the fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake he declared in a sober 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television irresponsible slogans political instigation setting one national group against another the domination of some ethnic groups by others -- this could lead to disaster for us all the living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness with serious ethnic clashes in soviet central asia over the past month with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of armenia azerbaijan and georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania gorbachev is struggling to hold the soviet union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances even as he spoke soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this time between georgians and azerbaijanis inside the georgian republic but in an area with many azerbaijanis roving gangs armed with hunting rifles gasoline bombs and other weapons had clashed in three towns south of the capital of tbilisi last week leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded although limited so far in scope some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war gorbachev suggested and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors those who encourage the unrest are playing with fire gorbachev said warning that the government will use its full powers and take the most decisive measures against those provoking the clashes organizing attacks on minority groups or urging secession nearly 300 people have been killed in communal clashes and related political disturbances over the past two years tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes including 40000 last month alone to seek refuge from the violence and nearly 25000 special troops are now deployed in various parts of the country to maintain order there will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken the criminal path gorbachev said warning of stern measures against those engaged in communal violence or in political agitation political energy drained the ethnic strife much of it rooted in past soviet policies of domination by ethnic russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the stalinist era has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change for gorbachev the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the soviet union a superpower in world terms cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government -- nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms if the strife here continued and grew he asked what kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world of equal gravity for gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the baltic republics and in armenia georgia and moldavia a soviet republic on the romanian border the whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level communist party conference here late last week and gorbachev's unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are wound in a tight knot of contradictions because of previous soviet policies particularly the effort to pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new soviet nationality with a unified culture this policy had in fact collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse past economic policies including the stagnation in many regions under the regime of the late president leonid i brezhnev had also made the problems more acute we are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades -- the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups gorbachev said alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator josef stalin such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the country's different peoples the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in inter-ethnic relations although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the communist party's policy-making central committee in late july and then debated again by the congress of people's deputies the country's new national assembly gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis right of equality everyone regardless of his nationality should feel an equal citizen in any part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights guaranteed by the soviet union's constitution he said the refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country gorbachev said alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on mesketian turks in uzbekistan last month in which about 100 people died the soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling of various ethnic groups that they are at home in their own land and could preserve and develop their own cultures languages and social traditions with the soviet union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system but he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there is a balance of rights we have lived and will continue to live in a multi-ethnic community he observed gorbachev said that profound transformations in the soviet federation are clearly essential promising further political reforms to make it a real federation and not just one in name only demands rejected but he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence demanded by some nationalists particularly in estonia latvia and lithuania and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories the soviet union's ethnic groups have a common destiny gorbachev said in quest of the better one should not embark on the path of destroying what has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and what can be multiplied within its framework he said map areas of ethnic strife los angeles times gorbachev mikhail s speeches ethnic groups demonstrations -- ussr racial relations -- ussr nationalism

leader of the campaign and breaks curfew as the first act of defiance in december he is arrested and charged under suppression of communism act he gets a suspended sentence and is barred from attending meetings or leaving johannesburg december 1956 a campaign of civil disobedience by the anc results in mandela being detained along with 155 others and charged with treason the trial which lasts until 1961 ends in acquittal march 1960 sixty-nine black protesters are killed by police in sharpeville a state of emergency is declared and the anc is outlawed january 1962 attends pan-african

negotiate commentary anthony lewis is a new york times columnist in the 15 months since he walked free from prison nelson mandela has played the chief role in talks with president fw de klerk and the white government he has presided over an african national congress divided and not yet organized for politics he has spent his moral capital trying unsuccessfully to end the murderous conflict between black political factions now mandela is confronted with his wife's conviction for a brutal criminal offense he has loyally defended her innocence he has seemed to hear no voice to the contrary but events have caught up the radicals in the anc may well use the trial and conviction of mrs mandela to arouse members against nelson mandela's policy of peace and negotiation there are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as mandela and walter sisulu aside to a nominal senior role it is a gloomy picture an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in south africa beset by problems personal trauma on top of political but i think it would be wrong to conclude that the south african drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end one reason for a degree of optimism is the way south africans on all sides most of them have dealt with winnie mandela's trial calmly and fairly during the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused but from all one can tell this trial was handled professionally by the judge justice michael stegmann the reaction to the verdict and six-year prison sentence was also mild surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer mrs mandela the anc issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case archbishop desmond tutu said the movement is larger than any individual a more fundamental reason for hope is that fw de klerk and nelson mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new non-racial south africa they need each other without their agreement there can be no solution no outcome that leaves a viable country the next step is formal negotiations they can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable anc demand for action against violence -- in particular a ban on the carrying of so-called cultural weapons such as spears how can the government look away when 1000 zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents the time factor is crucial now negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public black and white is to retain hope

drought hitting north america is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries the un food and agriculture organization reported today the agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1785 billion tons only two million tons more than last year's level which was already below the expected production if the drought in the united states ended now grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983 when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output the agency reported as a result world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security the report said if crop conditions in the united states and canada continue to deteriorate the ratio could drop even further such a development would have serious implications for the food security particularly of many low-income food-deficit countries the report said the high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor food-importing countries the hardest the un agency warned it said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries the most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize barley and oats the report said the agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world in asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time and production in europe and the soviet is expected to be larger than last year grain production in south america should be slightly lower this year than last in the sahel region of sub-saharan africa however locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's harvest potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons

the 1930s and 1950s lyng said even with the severe drought there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the united states will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand he said lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher but it is important to note that

offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months a new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months the disappointing forecast came as president reagan headed to the midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms on tuesday the agriculture department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops that was followed wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the national weather service saying that drought-stricken areas from the dakotas east to new york and from the canadian border to oklahoma arkansas and tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain that area which includes the major grain-growing states where crops already are suffering is given a 55 percent chance of less than normal rainfall and some states in the center of the area stretching from west virginia to nebraska and from wisconsin to missouri may be even drier they are given a 60 percent chance of being short of precipitation a slice of southern california including los angeles is the driest area in the forecast

state and national experts was sponsored by the weather channel an atlanta-based cable network which broadcast the meeting live john hope the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster

symposium here society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria said pat michaels virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium he said the 1988 drought although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers i'm worried that when the next drought happens we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem said michaels president of the association of state climatologists experts said thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warming of the earth's atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate even though it is not directly related to the drought many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the earth's temperature is warming but they debated whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on earth however alan hecht director of the national climate program in washington dc said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels he said by becoming more energy efficient replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies scientists have warned in recent years that earth's atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise besides fossil fuels the depletion of forests in south america has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries for example drying out the us midwest or melting polar ice caps the symposium was sponsored by the weather channel an atlanta-based cable network which broadcast the meeting live earlier thursday the climatologists were told the movement of planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the southeast there is some

has also accused kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries costing iraq of much-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are higher the statement on the iraqi news agency said the border dispute would be settled with fraternity and arab national interests indicating iraq would probably take the land it wants the statement

president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979 the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below $14 per barrel he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries he also accused kuwait of stealing $24 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war saddam was reported to be incensed that kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran never mind that iraq started the war in 1980 by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shatt-al-arab waterway iraq's only outlet to the gulf despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraq's development dragging on for eight years it has still not formally ended the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war the 1990 budget slashed funds for imports and iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity private investment has failed to take hold iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt its main gulf port of basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated 500000 iraqis were killed or wounded despite its puny size kuwait's oil reserves almost match iraq's 100 billion barrels by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline iraq's 100000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraq's demands but kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddam's promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers although a civil war in yemen in the 1960s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait the invasion shook kuwait's neighbors along the gulf it proved the decade-old gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless the gcc did not issue a statement much less implement its mutual defense treaty while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraq's chemical

saddam hussein's force would be capable of penetrating kuwait or saudi arabia the agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade intelligence officials say but as the buildup grew the cia became

sea and back into history finding a treasure-laden turkish warship sunk by greek revolutionaries in 1822 the remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of chios in the eastern aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the ottoman ship according to peter nicolaides a diver and salvage expert the bourloti seimaz _ or explosives invincible _ was set afire and sunk by greek admiral constantine kanaris in revenge for turkish killing and looting on chios thousands of islanders died in the turkish raids which shocked other nations and swung western european countries behind the greek struggle for independence from the ottoman empire greece won independence in 1830 the french painter eugene delacroix produced a famous picture the massacre of chios based on the raids it's an incredible discovery straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the war of independence nicolaides said in an interview friday with the associated press nicolaides who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles he pinpointed the wreck on may 3 he said when i dived i found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects _ islamic cooking pots cannon balls a candlestick even a chalice from a greek orthodox church he said the ship was obviously crammed with loot from chios i think there may be gold and silver items as well he said i also saw what i recognized as human bones he added he said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet in length according to historians more than 1000 people _ including 400 greek captives _ were aboard the ship when kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of june 7 1822 the greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of psara towing a boat stuffed with explosives its pointed bow was rammed into the mouth of a cannon on the bourloti seimaz and a fuse lit the ottoman commander admiral kara ali was killed in the blast that split the ship kanaris and his crew of greeks escaped this is a very significant very emotive find coming from this particular period of history said george papathanassopoulos the culture ministry's adviser on marine archaeology papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet but he said this is a ship that must be explored nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap american and turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project american experts from the institute of nautical archaeology at texas a & m university working in cooperation with turkish divers have pioneered underwater excavation off the turkish aegean coast greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered around the aegean and rarely

coast it was sunk june 4 50 years after the us coast guard turned away the ss st louis as its more than 900 jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the holocaust the sinking site was supposed to be near where the coast guard intercepted the st louis whose passengers also were turned away by cuba and forced to return to europe most of the passengers later died in nazi concentration camps for unexplained reasons the ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site and is resting in 25 feet of water on a living reef it was truly an incredible incredible historic event and

feinsilber associated press writer washington ap a deep-sea inspection of the bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in adolf hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the british in a celebrated battle underwater explorer robert d ballard said thursday during a 90-minute news conference ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago then the american oceanographer whose father was of british background and whose mother was of german heritage addressed himself to the german people in german i am an underwater explorer not a treasure hunter he said translating himself back into english we found no human remains we touched nothing and took nothing the future of the bismarck is in the hands of the german people he said he will disclose its exact location only to germany so germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship which sank after a battle may 27 1941 ballard a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts said structural evidence satisfied him that the germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by british fire only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece ballard said it appears the crew opened it up along its entire length it was clearly flooded stem to stern maybe the germans didn't want it taken as a war prize he added it is known that two years earlier hitler ordered the german pocket battleship graf spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of montevideo uruguay and attacked by british ships hitler apparently wanted to keep the british from learning the secrets of the graf spee's construction and weapons in the 1941 battle the bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking british ships were out of range of her secondary guns ballard said so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered british biplanes it was unable to escape asked if the german commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the british would have recognized that the germans were giving up again he speculated perhaps the germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into british hands the bismarck was found by ballard in more than 15000 feet of water about 600 miles west of brest france he said it was in remarkably good shape elegant well preserved before the battle british prime minister winston churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command sink the bismarck of the bismarck's 2200-man crew only about 115 survived british ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of german sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a german u-boat german vessels later rescued only five more survivors the story has been recounted in books songs and a movie the sinking occurred only eight days after the bismarck left gdynia poland for her first operation if unstopped it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut british morale at a time when england stood virtually alone against combined german sea and air power the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but within five days of going to sea the bismarck had sunk the hood in a

ft 30 sep 94 / leading article defying the cruel sea ferries are among the safest vessels afloat but as the tragic sinking of the estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates when they do go down the toll in human life can be high as ferries increase in size so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up the move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side it can lead to the vessel capsizing the united nations international maritime organisation imo and its members the ship-owning nations have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety but the sinking of the estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the herald of free enterprise in 1987 unlike the herald the estonia appears to have had its doors closed but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues first the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks these proposals were looked at by the british government in the wake of the sinking of the herald of free enterprise it calculated that it would cost between pounds 70m and pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the uk ferry fleet with a further pounds 22m in extra annual running costs higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when on the short cross-channel routes they face competition from the channel tunnel but the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster second the imo and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations the imo has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners third the imo should be given support by national governments in its campaign launched yesterday to improve crew training much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment above all if new regulation does turn out to be necessary it must be introduced speedily as things stand it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force the european union which sweden and finland are getting ready to join could take a lead in speeding up the process ship safety is not of course just an issue for the ferry sector five small ferries were lost last year according to lloyd's register but this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down when a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean very little attention is paid if the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in european waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the estonia countries- eez estonia east europe gbz united kingdom ec industries- p9621

executive in a number of maxwell companies is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from mirror group newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year according to the chairman's statement released with mgn accounts yesterday mr kevin maxwell and mr ian maxwell two sons of the late robert maxwell are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions mr kevin maxwell and mr stoney refused to provide mgn with information the statement says sir robert clark chairman of mgn lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months he says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations including goldman sachs the us investment bank over more than pounds 40m in transfers from mgn if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes' notes to the accounts show that mgn made extraordinary provisions of pounds 4215m in the year to december 29 1991 including pounds 2086m in pension deficiencies and pounds 1224m in transactions with maxwell-controlled companies sir robert says that during the year there were at least 28 'unusual' payments for more than pounds 1m from the group's bank accounts making a total of more than pounds 180m 'some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions' nine of the payments were authorised solely by robert maxwell the others were authorised mainly by mr kevin maxwell mr ian maxwell and mr michael stoney he says one transfer to goldman sachs was countersigned by mr ernest burrington former managing director at the request of mr kevin maxwell on the reported instruction of robert maxwell two authorisations were countersigned by mr lawrence guest former mgn finance director sir robert says the mgn directors do not believe that either mr burrington or mr guest knew there was anything improper about these payments with these exceptions 'the independent directors were not involved in and did not authorise or approve any of these payments' he says sir robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department - which was headed by mr stoney - about 'the nature of certain transactions' including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits 'the treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those 'deposits he says in his report sir robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the mgn board internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval bank mandates authorised by robert maxwell and mr stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of maxwell or directors who were also directors of maxwell-controlled companies the audit committee of non-executive directors which might have reviewed systems and mandates but was not convened the finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities the report details a pounds 50m loan made by bankers trust in london last october which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from bankers trust in new york to robert maxwell group parent of the maxwell private interests separately the statement highlights three transfers of more than pounds 40m from mgn to goldman sachs - pounds 11m of this was transferred on robert maxwell's signature to pay for previous dealings in maxwell communication corporation stock the balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by bishopsgate investment trust and robert maxwell group it says he says mgn is inquiring to see whether it can establish if goldman sachs was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected for improper purposes' if so he says 'it will be possible to seek orders against them for the sums paid' he says mgn is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases and

on the purchase of pounds 55m of mcc shares from the pension schemes by two swiss trusts servex and yakosa which were transacted through goldman and for which the schemes were never paid the writs allege goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by robert maxwell the writs also allege that on may 28 1991 - the same date mr kevin maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - goldman was due to receive dollars 582m for an unrelated transaction selling mcc stock to an unnamed american lawyer 'with close connections to robert maxwell' the writs claim that goldman was 'competing directly with its customer the pension fund trustee for payment' on april 26 1991 they say mr kevin maxwell told mr sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the swiss trusts on

and savage disappointment by rc murthy the 29-storey jijobhoy towers home of the bombay stock exchange was rocked by two powerful bombs last friday leaving 60 dead and 200 injured the market reopened on monday in an attempt to return to normal it has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring where it stopped a year ago dealers seemed to like this the bse index rising by 56 per cent on monday and tuesday but another bomb blast in calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday and the index came back by 5062 or 21 per cent to 240923 all this has taken place against a volatile background the bombay equity market over the past six weeks or so has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation before the national budget on february 27 and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment dr manmohan singh the indian finance minister disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month he postponed corporate tax reforms by a year denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group he did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front but left out the cement and steel sectors where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget speculation to top it all dr singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains he lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 445 per cent taking the tax concessions for granted traders had driven up share prices in february to make a kill later instead the budget turned out to be a nightmare while industry and business welcomed the statement which for once did not propose any new tax professor rusi taraporewala the stock market theorist and academic said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year the relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and until the weekend the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of reliance industries arbitraging between the share price on the bombay stock exchange and the market price of its euro-issue of global depository receipts gdrs the opportunity arose after a change in indian regulations which allows international investors to convert gdrs into the underlying stock at the current conversion rate of rs31 per us dollar the reliance gdr fetched rs170 per share against the bse quotation of rs210 the bse 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2287 on march 10 from 2893 at the post-budget trading session on february 27 share prices rebounded last week taking the index to 2361 and the uptrend on balance has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on friday whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend

rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1200 injured 'i'm lucky to be alive' he said from his hospital bed 'who did this who can stop this happening again' across bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend they sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in december and again in january those were caused by a traditional mix of crime political agitation and ancient hindu-moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in ayodhya the weapons used were mostly primitive - knives clubs and petrol bottles friday's outrage by contrast bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism complete with semtex plastic explosive high-grade timers efficient organisation and money the only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of mr rajiv gandhi the former prime minister by sri lanka's tamil tiger terrorists but that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital bombay accounts for 35 per cent of india's exports mr p v narasimha rao the prime minister described the blasts as an attack on india's economy the immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help but these suggestions were seen in bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects - moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit india after the ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2000 dead including 700 in bombay if moslems are found to have staged the attacks the indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a moslem country notably pakistan the implications would be vast breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step delhi could take on a dangerous road mr rao chose his words carefully during his visit to bombay 'there is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country i do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country' there is no evidence linking the attacks to moslem extremists let alone to pakistan even if moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings they could have been supplied from other moslem countries india would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale for the moment such concerns seem remote from the streets on bombay where the atmosphere

945-inch mirror to starlight hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff however nasa said it will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the constellation carina _ a week after launch in addition to the $15 billion cost of hubble $500 million has been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument the european space agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time nasa estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space during its 15-year working lifetime the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories as a result they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 billion years astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end the telescope is named for the late astronomer

many years said nasa administrator richard truly hubble's in its element and i'm delighted the telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983 but technical problems and the challenger accident delayed its deployment it suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle while it remained on earth the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness in its first day in space that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland

galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars' said truly a former shuttle astronaut it doesn't matter what day we launch hubble it matters that we do it right the telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter about the size of a railroad tank car when it flies free it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is traveling that gave support to the theory that a massive explosion _ the big bang _ created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago the hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions how old is the universe how big is it the telescope has two mirrors one 945 inches in diameter the other 12 inches two of the instruments are cameras two are spectrometers and one is a photometer in addition the fine pointing

astronomy astronaut kathy sullivan said friday as she circled the earth in space shuttle discovery the eyepiece from the mount wilson observatory's 100-inch hooker telescope was carried into orbit by sullivan after she brings the eyepiece back to earth it will be placed on display at the observatory it's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy said lyn mcafee spokeswoman for the mount wilson institute the pasadena-based group runs the observatory located in the san gabriel mountains outside los angeles the discoveries made by hubble on the 100-inch telescope at mount wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe mcafee said we believe the hubble space telescope will do the same thing the hooker telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948 when the 200-inch hale telescope was placed in operation at mount palomar observatory northeast of san diego using the hooker telescope hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the milky way the institute said in a statement this crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy the institute said during the 1920s and 1930s hubble and an assistant used the hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly this provided observational evidence for the concept suggested by einstein's theory of relativity that the universe is expanding the institute said hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion called the big bang an estimated 15 billion years ago the hooker

the use of its high-speed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations we are out of the `safe-mode' right now said steve terry a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope he said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing discovery's astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some last-minute observations of earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe it's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden it makes little kids' eyes light up it makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science the telescope's big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite the antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly we expect to use that data to investigate what happened he said engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed we're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in effect a standby mode he said shortly after 6 am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor hubble's health it will take another day before the $15 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier we're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems olivier said friday this is not the time to do anything dumb the telescope

mission control commentator james hartsfield the astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home they also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the johnson space center shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to earth the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above earth but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday morning exposing the telescope's finely polished 945-inch eye to starlight for the first time two of hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on line the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director of orbital verifications at goddard a colleague steve terry said hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions there also were two communications outages totaling several hours hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods terry said nasa had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina but terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems scientific data will follow in a month or two the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe the universe is believed to have

ever created a $15-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye seven years behind schedule the telescope will be deployed by astronaut steven hawley an astronomer on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see it's been long and frustrating conceded edward weiler program scientist for the national aeronautics and space administration who was visibly shaken by the launch every astronomer he said softly should take today off the launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the exploration of the universe after 12 years astronomer eric chaisson of the space telescope science institute said with a sigh it has finally left the earth high above the haze of the earth's atmosphere the hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on earth today the telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a seven-month checkout and engineering period then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe after the deployment engineers at the goddard space flight center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months there will be a few teasers early on in about seven days the hubble should snap its first picture -- what astronomers call first light for the telescope -- but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much the image of a cluster of stars in the southern sky will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase so it may not even be in focus but it will still represent a historic moment the stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts said caltech's james westphal principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera but however it comes out it's going to be great it will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity there will be other space telescopes in the years ahead but there will never be another moment quite like this every bit of 12 years was worth it weiler said moments after discovery lifted off on a sunny day pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future sadly some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch they were here two weeks ago but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to cape canaveral weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here april 10 made it back for tuesday's launch among the missing were most of the families who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history there was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically halting the countdown at 31 seconds before launch the valve was ordered by computer to correct its position and it did so clearing the way for the countdown to resume that delayed the launch about four minutes but at 534 am pdt with air force col loren j shriver 45 sitting in the commander's seat the shuttle lifted off all five members of

for hawley 38 sullivan and mccandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope the most anxious moments will come as hawley gently lifts the 25000-pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay he will do that with the shuttle's robotic arm which he tested in the first hours of the flight the arm however tends to drift slightly so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope's two giant solar arrays are unfurled the solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries charged and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged so sullivan and mccandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl the solar arrays if necessary after the telescope is released and functioning on its own the discovery will back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around earth for two days if anything goes wrong during that period the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and mccandless and sullivan can go out and work on the problem if there are no problems discovery will land at 649 am pdt sunday

read in their homes carey who lives in sydney with his wife and son said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won if i'd known i was going to win i think i would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting he said as he stared down at his notes he was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel illywhacker was among the final six carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsors for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow everyone who loves good books benefits from this surely he added the winning novel is a fitting choice for australia's bicentennial year it tells of a romance between an english gambler and an australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to australia in the mid-19th century the story weaves in australian history from its founding in 1788 by british immigrants panel chairman michael foot a writer and former leader of the opposition labor party said the judges agreed that entries this year had been exceptionally strong and that choosing the last six novels was extremely difficult we hope there will be no criticisms but if there are then people should start reading the books for themselves foot said carey was the only non-briton in the final six the son

said the judges the panel was unanimous however in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult ms byatt who earlier this month won the $43000 irish times-aer lingus prize for international fiction for the same work has published five novels since 1964 in possession she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across england and to france the influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book ms byatt born in 1936 is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist margaret drabble her first novel shadow of a sun concerned the efforts of

they have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today george du maurier's trilby anthony hope's the prisoner of zenda george moore's esther waters kipling's jungle book george gissing's in the year of jubilee and rl stevenson's the ebb tide the winner will be revealed on october 15 four days after the 1994 booker prize ceremony at the cheltenham festival of literature like today's booker prize it is a publishing gimmick everyman which is backing the spoof award is a significant publisher of classic victorian novels but the retrospective booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction it raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years first the similarities a good yarn is a good yarn of the 1894 books trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist svengali then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts the prisoner of zenda tells of an englishman impersonating the king of ruritania and rescuing him from demons on the 1994 list romesh guneskera's reef is about a sri lankan servant boy and his mysterious master while jill paton walsh's knowledge of angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend all the books on both lists are gripping stories the lists share key themes both for instance have books about colonial exploitation - stevenson's the ebb tide and abdulrazak gurnah's paradise which is set in the first world war in german east africa both provoke in similar ways the controversial books of 1894 were trilby with its louche vie boheme milieu and esther waters in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver it is now seen as moore's best work but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it a century on the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed last week a times critic complained about the inclusion of alan hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love the folding star on the booker list because it offended judaeo-christian ethics but even if hollinghurst wins the booker his novel will not become the succes de scandale of esther waters and trilby which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century for the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a booker prize was not needed to sell fiction today we accept the gap between literary writing such as hollinghurst's and popular bestsellers by writers like jeffrey archer and barbara cartland this is the gap the booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience the trick works - last year's winner roddy doyle's paddy clarke ha ha ha sold 360000 hardback copies before the short-list was announced it sold 10600 the victorians in contrast were lovers of contemporary fiction novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books and no distinction was made between high and low art in the mid 19th century dickens made pounds 12000 for little dorrit the equivalent of nearly pounds 400000 today between 1861 and 1894 when the population of the uk was half that of today and the literate population smaller still mrs henry wood's east lynne sold 400000 copies all the 1894 booker writers were popular names they were also serious skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894 social cultural and psychological reasons play a part socially the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite the idea of a two-tier up and down-market fiction was irrelevant culturally these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream and the novel was their political and intellectual forum today we no longer share the victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by joyce and woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow the dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents george du maurier originally offered the outline of trilby to henry james who he thought would write a better novel today du maurier would have sold it to hollywood or the bbc the fantasy element of fiction in which we identify with characters as if we know them was answered in the 19th century by the novel in the 20th century we have tv soaps just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from eastenders so when dickens' the old curiosity shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether little nell would die and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved sentimentality accessibility topicality - what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894 both in the year of jubilee and esther waters for example centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage feminism and the 'new woman' yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed the 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from freud the ebb tide paved the way for conrad's heart of darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression it is unlikely that the 1994 booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings many of the 1994 books are historical such as paradise or are driven by nostalgia such as beside the ocean of time which book will win on october 15 stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in samoa the setting of the ebb tide jungle book will get the retrospective vote because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of mowgli's jungle its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery my vote goes to trilby soft-focus ideologically shaky - in its anti-semitic portrait of svengali - and sometimes sloppy it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory like rebecca the popular novel by du maurier's granddaughter it is a natural equivalent of what the current booker prize seeks to create a

omission as do new novels by peter ackroyd peter carey candia mcwilliam william trevor and jim crace but if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever one unsurprising omission from the final selection was when the world was steady a first novel by claire messud which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of james wood chief literary reviewer of the guardian newspaper and a booker judge professor john bayley chairman of the booker panel and husband of former booker prize winner dame iris murdoch expressed surprise at mr wood's failure to reveal his relationship with ms messud but it is the final list rather than the controversy that discredits the

mr james kelman for how late it was how late published by secker and warburg the novel a story of scottish low-life narrated largely in glaswegian dialect is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable professor john bayley chairman of the booker judges acknowledged that mr kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible 'we had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided' he said after three hours of debate rabbi julia neuberger the only woman on the judging panel said she was made extremely cross by the decision 'it's just a drunken scotsman railing against bureaucracy' she said 'my eyes are stretched in disbelief the voting system is completely

favorite at 7-4 followed by peter ackroyd 5-2 iris murdoch 3-1 and chinua achebe 9-2 the two dark horses nina bawden and penelope lively were each tipped at 7-1 you may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup an affinity with the bookshelf not the bookie all of those people published new works of fiction here in britain during the past 12 months and for the last few weeks literary punters throughout the british isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the booker prize the best-known best-liked and almost incidentally most prestigious fiction award in the land in recent weeks the booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the charles and di rift and nearly every article from book reviews to author interviews has featured the latest odds the betting is done largely by literary insiders says graham sharpe who sets the booker odds at william hill britain's other big betting agency they read the books hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves he says last year's winner the old devils by kingsley amis was a 5-2 favorite but this year anyone who chose the victor made some dough when she accepted her prize for moon tiger penelope lively looked surprised and pleased i'm not a betting woman and i have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport she said in soft oxbridge tones but those who are in the know tell me that 7-1 was an irresistible flutter her 65-year-old mother was among those who made a killing america has the pulitzer prize for fiction and the national book awards but in terms of excitement hoopla and man-on-the-street interest there's nothing akin to the 15000-pound $26000 booker prize with the possible exception of france's respected prix goncourt there's nothing quite like it anywhere else britons wryly compare the booker to the academy awards and though there's just one prize and no envelope similarities exist there's a team of judges and a pool of candidates this year each british publisher could submit three new titles for a grand total of 93 as one judge noted wearily by august i was in more than a slight panic sometimes reading all day and evening reading while standing at the bus stop reading while cooking reading almost while talking on the telephone next comes the short-list the judges' top six which was announced with great fanfare in late september this year the works included brian moore's political thriller the color of blood ep dutton 182 pages $1695 peter ackroyd's chatterton grove press 240 pages $1795 nina bawden's circles of deceit st martin's press 208 pages $1495 iris murdoch's 23rd novel the book and the brotherhood viking 608 pages $1995 nigerian writer chinua achebe's anthills of the savannah doubleday 240 pages $1695 and moon tiger grove press 216 pages $1595 the awards presentation came on the last thursday in october and like any major awards presentation it came complete with limousines banquet salmon mousse champagne sorbet and english roast beef and television cameras the suspense was genuine the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement to be sure the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of eastenders britain's popular soap opera yet interest was sufficient for andre deutsch moon tiger's british publisher to order up an additional 20000 copies almost the minute mrs lively -- and the nation -- heard the news by british standards sales figures for recent booker winners are stunning from the old devils 80000 hard-cover

literary fiction so far 10000 copies have sold being short-listed probably changed the destiny of that book declares a member of the heinemann sales staff indeed there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography another notable spinoff is the booker harpies readers intent on digesting all six titles then vigorously disputing the choices which never please everyone this year the sunday times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112 perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot it wasn't always this way of course headlines were modest back in 1969 when ph newby won the first ever booker prize for something to answer for the wonderfully appropriate name comes from booker-mcconnell plc the international food and agriculture conglomerate that puts up the prize money each year the idea was to devise a british equivalent to the prix goncourt and like that august french award the booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy the early fuss was kept within the literary world with critics sniping over choices and the prize's varied ground rules the real world took notice in 1974 when elizabeth jane howard one of the three judges wrote a letter to the times claiming that in her opinion kingsley amis's ending up one of the short-listed books was his best ever as it happens she was married to mr amis at the time he didn't win but many credit the booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and thomas keneally's schindler's ark or schindler's list as it is known in the us written as a novel the book told the true story of a remarkable german who saved the lives of hundreds of jews in concentration camps but even after it won the booker people argued that it wasn't a novel the more people questioned it the more it sold says ion trewin editorial director at hodder & stoughton that was the first year the prize caught the

told senate armed services committee leaders that tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting an unidentified congressional source told the washington post that combest's statement about tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on sen sam nunn the committee chairman like a ton of bricks and was a factor in nunn's opposition to the nomination the newspaper reported that combest later gave a different story to the fbi saying that tower and a group of friends _ not tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch after meeting with staff and advisers combest who worked for then-sen tower in the 1970s issued a two-sentence statement supporting his fellow texan as a member of congress i have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's armed forces in my judgment john tower will be a superb secretary of defense the statement said combest spokesman rich adams refused to comment further and said combest was not available to speak to reporters the washington post reported that combest described for nunn and sen john w warner of virginia the ranking republican on the committee tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s a congressional source was quoted as saying that combest told the senators that tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week trudi boyd combest's administrative assistant told the post that combest originally went to nunn and warner to tell them tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol boyd also told the post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch not tower alone that was the account combest gave the fbi following his talk with nunn and warner the newspaper said it said that in that account combest said that he had only seen tower drunk on two or three occasions tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner on sunday he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense secretary combest 43 worked for tower for seven years 1971-1978 as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy tower

rejected the nomination of former texas sen john tower as defense secretary delivering a major rebuke to president bush just 49 days into his term the senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on tower's drinking habits behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors it was only the ninth time in 200 years that the senate has voted to reject a president's cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration vice president dan quayle presided over the senate during the roll call underscoring bush's commitment to the nominee the senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats as the roll was called the nomination of john tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed quayle intoned after the vote kansas gop sen nancy kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole republican to declare her opposition she said her most serious concerns were over tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator she also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military tower's republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat even before the roll was called just moments ago i took a call from john tower said sen john warner of virginia the senior gop member of the senate armed services committee his head is high his voice is strong warner said he asked me to convey thanks _ in his words _ to the troops who rallied to his support senate majority leader george mitchell d-maine moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the senate and president bush i know what's in my heart and in my mind he told reporters i want to directly clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking there was no doubt about the outcome as the senate went through the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours before the roll call the last few undecided senators declared their positions sen john b breaux d-la said he would vote against tower sen james m jeffords r-vt said he would support the nomination senators from both parties credited tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him made by sen sam nunn d-ga chairman of the armed services committee when he made his decision all the other democrats wheeled in behind him said sen john chafee r-ri with the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said if necessary we'll come up with a new candidate very rapidly names most frequently mentioned in white house speculation as a replacement for tower if his nomination failed are sen warner a former secretary of the navy former defense secretary donald rumsfeld former rep jack edwards r-ala and national security adviser brent scowcroft scowcroft replied no when asked this morning if he was in line for the pentagon job it must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue fitzwater said but the time has not come he added the time will come as soon as the vote is completed we will wait until then the most recent associated press survey showed 52 democrats and one republican committed to vote against tower or leaning strongly in that direction it showed 41 republicans and three democrats declared for tower or leaning his way nevertheless the white house said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote tower meanwhile reported for work at the pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together he then continued a review of various administration proposals i hope and believe we can work together on important matters mitchell said the tension of this issue will have no long-lasting effect on the relationship i want to say from the bottom of my heart that i hope this will be the case the already slim chance tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on wednesday as a parade of previously undecided democratic senators announced they would vote no only democrat lloyd bentsen of texas said he would vote yes joining just two other democrats who have made that decision sens charles robb d-va joseph lieberman d-conn j bennett johnston d-la dale bumpers d-ark and claiborne pell d-ri all said they would vote against tower johnston said his reading of the fbi report on tower leaves him with the clear impression that tower's personality changes when he drinks heavily leading to

from tower defeat an ap news analysis by walter r mears ap special correspondent washington ap john g tower has fallen but the sky has not for all the forecasts of dire results if the senate blocked tower's path to the pentagon business is proceeding as usual president bush said the case was closed and accepted democratic assurances of future cooperation that doesn't undo the resentment among some of tower's more ardent republican allies in the senate and in some corners of the white house bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen senate democrats they ended up with only three democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against tower nevertheless a week after the former texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed there will be ripples and some of them could be wave-sized the good-behavior rules set in the debate over tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever republicans spot a democratic target we've established what will be known as the tower standards said sen john warner r-va that argument will be used by house republicans challenging the financial conduct of house speaker jim wright but it will be a debating point not a turning point in a wright controversy that was ordained long before the tower episode while president bush was unwavering in his support of tower he burned no bridges to congressional democrats he insisted that tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed but he didn't get nasty about it saying there was no point in escalating the fight that's over he said 24 hours after the tower defeat that's history and now we are going to go forward the 53-47 vote against tower was a setback to bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when congress denies a president something he wants but this denial did not cost bush a program or a major campaign pledge or the support of voters indeed it could turn out that the senate did the president a favor by sending tower back to texas instead of to the pentagon it was a break bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the pentagon job since ronald reagan was elected president tower had not been a reagan man _ he had supported bush for the 1980 nomination and the reagan white house went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought declaring that the new president would not be nominating any senate republican for any cabinet post after tower's long wait bush displayed his own loyalty all the way to a losing vote when the standard somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee tower not only shunned withdrawal he offered conditions that had to be humiliating if only the senate would let him have the job tower promised to quit drinking taking the pledge on national television and when that didn't work he offered to become the first-ever probationary cabinet member republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency no deal so tower became the ninth cabinet nominee ever to be rejected the first who was a former senator bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own cabinet but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes tower did not restrain himself battling for the job he said withdrawal would damage bush and rejection would be damning the president's judgment he said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat tower's advocates on the senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake that the authority of the presidency was on the line that the senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the tower decision but bush said all along that the outcome either way would not hurt on other issues sen sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee and the pivotal figure in the tower defeat agreed he told his georgia constituents that the tower rejection would not hurt bush's leadership in washington `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived nunn said and that's particularly true of the president editor's note

part 1 page 1 column 3 national desk 811 words tower's 'moral character' hit by conservative by melissa healy times staff writer washington in the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a bush administration cabinet nominee a prominent conservative told a senate panel tuesday that john tower may lack the moral character to be secretary of defense over the course of many years i have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married conservative activist paul m weyrich told the senate armed services committee i encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression he added criticism from weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former texas senator but several members conceded that while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the pentagon's top job he probably will win senate approval anyway we've had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge said committee chairman sam nunn d-ga weyrich president of the conservative free congress foundation testified that tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and management reform in an extraordinary challenge to tower's nomination weyrich also suggested that tower's moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments to bring pressure on the united states government and on him personally it is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life weyrich said private morals have public effects tower 63 and twice-divorced served 24 years in the senate from texas including a tenure as chairman of the armed services committee from 1981 to 1984 he has been dogged by reports that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the pentagon faces in announcing tower as his choice for the post on dec 16 president bush called the talk a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless saying that nixon went to china bush added that tower's record of support for pentagon spending hikes could be overturned but weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of tower's fitness for the job after two days of testimony last week in which tower won broad praise from committee members ties to contractors fulbright institute scholar william c jackson jr and william g phillips president of the washington-based national council for industrial defense joined weyrich tuesday in opposing tower's nomination phillips echoed jackson's complaint that tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise serious doubts that john tower is the best man for the job at this time in our history a leading committee democrat acknowledged this point i wondered why the president of the united states chose john tower for this job given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing said nebraska sen james j exon but the facts of the matter are that he has sen john w warner r-va in clarifying the grounds on which senate committees may assess presidential nominees told witnesses that it is not a function of the senate to say that this individual this nominee is the best man qualified weyrich also told the committee that president bush's transition team received hundreds of letters opposing tower's nomination some of which contain specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of mr tower in a closed session of the committee weyrich was unable to add to his own observations with more than hearsay according to sen malcolm wallop r-wyo weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or content of the letters but the allegation reviewed in advance by the committee prompted nunn and warner the panel's ranking minority member to write white house counsel c boyden gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the fbi and addressed in the bureau's report to the committee wallop a tower supporter and a leading senate conservative termed it troublesome that innuendoes have been made the insinuations are on the table but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable in open testimony weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among conservative activists that tower is not committed to the pentagon's star wars missile defense program he considers sdi the strategic defense initiative a bargaining chip weyrich said we don't the panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week nunn said and expects to meet once more today to consider tower's nomination tower john political appointments bush george weyrich paul m la020489-0035 14013 february 4 1989 saturday home edition part 1 page 1 column 3 national desk 913 words tower probed on new charge of being drunk by john m broder times staff writer washington in its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee john tower the fbi is checking allegations that tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness sources said friday -- allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him but a senior member of the armed services committee who asked not to be identified said friday that the new allegation if true suggests that the former texas senator's drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt the charge received wednesday by the committee was very specific giving the date and place of the alleged incident and was made by an informant who identified herself a knowledgeable source said the episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the monocle a capitol hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers lobbyists and congressional aides two other allegations under scrutiny by the fbi's special inquiries unit which is working around the clock this weekend on the tower matter involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified dallas woman if the new charges should be verified by the fbi tower's nomination is doomed an authoritative committee source said fbi agents spent two hours at the monocle friday interviewing the owner the maitre d' bartenders and waiters the times learned the agents were told that tower when he was in the senate used to drink martinis wine or tonic water but one source said that no one on the staff contradicted tower's statement that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine in fact in recent weeks the staff told agents he often has ordered tonic water none of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by tower at the restaurant sources said on thursday the armed services committee had been set to approve the tower nomination but chairman sam nunn d-ga abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges which he referred immediately to fbi director william s sessions the bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of tower a 24-year senate veteran who headed the armed services panel from 1981 to 1985 when he nominated tower president bush said he was totally satisfied with the fbi check no results until tuesday nunn said he did not expect the latest fbi inquiry to be completed until at least tuesday tower friday refused to comment as he has throughout the confirmation inquiry some tower supporters complain that committee democrats are turning the confirmation process into a circus for partisan political reasons this is terribly cruel to a man who's just sort of hanging out there said committee member malcolm wallop r-wyo a tower supporter white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that our feeling is simply that we believe he will be confirmed but that whenever there are any new concerns raised they need to be looked into a senior white house staff member who asked not to be identified said administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in tower's confirmation everybody kind of wants to get our cabinet in the aide said people want to see him confirmed and on the job house armed services committee chairman les aspin d-wis said that the controversy has already hobbled tower's ability to lead the pentagon effectively this whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the pentagon in terms of running the place aspin said tower urged to withdraw and two influential defense industry trade magazines on monday will call for tower to withdraw from consideration for the pentagon post in an editorial prepared for monday's issue defense news a trade paper widely read by defense contractors and on capitol hill says withdrawal is necessary because the record of mr tower's professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness army times another prominent defense community publication says tower is unsuited for the defense department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986 it said that the speed and greed with which tower spun through the revolving door between government and industry is appalling tower has said that he was paid a total of more than $750000 by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service tower's profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of members of the armed services committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination called morally unfit tower's personal conduct however became an issue in the hearings on tuesday

staff writers washington the senate panel weighing john tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a british aircraft and weapons manufacturer congressional sources said friday tower testified last week that he had represented british aerospace inc only on civil aviation matters not as a consultant on military systems but in a divorce deposition taken in june 1987 tower stated that he had given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department in the deposition tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8000 a month records show that the payments continued from june 1986 until december 1988 also he served on the board of directors of the company the us subsidiary of british aerospace plc concerns about veracity the discrepancy sources said has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of tower's testimony before the senate armed services committee the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation and it raises the question of whether tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the foreign agents registration act they said tower's relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by some senators about his nomination lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over tower because of his employment by weapons firms which brought him at least $760000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200000 british aerospace paid him in his testimony tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a half-dozen us defense firms that do business with the pentagon the addition of the british firm to the list would add another -- and the first foreign-based firm -- whose interests could pose a potential conflict sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm tower aides said they had no comment on the matter a lengthy fbi investigation into tower's business dealings and his personal behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation the fbi is looking into new charges about tower's alleged drinking womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another 10 days the fbi is trying to determine whether tower who left the senate in 1985 after 24 years received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of unisys corp sources said friday the allegation was raised by a witness in the fbi's massive ill wind probe into corruption in pentagon weapons-buying federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former unisys executive charles f gardner said to be a central figure in the pentagon bribery investigation a unisys spokesman said friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees armed services committee chairman sam nunn d-ga and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved the sworn deposition about tower's business dealings was never filed in court because tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife lilla burt cummings but the document was obtained by the fbi as part of its background investigation of the nominee and is included in the committee's file on tower tower's testimony tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the american unit of british aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the company's commercial jets to us airlines he said also that he advised the firm on us trade legislation and gave opinions on currency fluctuations tower told the committee that he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities and did not include his income from british aerospace among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors in the divorce papers however tower said that he went to work for british aerospace inc on june 1 1986 eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator in the us-soviet strategic arms reductions talks in geneva around the same time he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms including rockwell international inc textron inc ltv corp and martin marietta corp in the deposition tower said that rockwell paid him $120000 a year but said he was underutilized by the firm he said he advised british aerospace on its chances of selling its training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon deposition cites weapons among the british aerospace products tower tried to sell to us military officials were the tornado fighter the hawk trainer the rapier anti-aircraft missile and the seawolf short-range air defense missile for ships according to the deposition he said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was plugged in in this town and knows the defense business pretty well he said that his contacts throughout government made him marketable the complex foreign agents registration act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the united states to register with the justice department no registration by tower is on file officials said in related developments -- vice president dan quayle talking to reporters on a flight to florida said that he had known tower for eight years and i have never seen him inebriated i have never seen drinking be a factor in john tower's life other than a social glass of wine those of us who know him worked with him can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem it did not affect him when he was chairman of the senate armed services committee when asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry he replied you have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense whether he will be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense let's focus on the qualifications -- tower's doctor said friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the former texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism dr r d dignan who performed surgery to remove a polyp from tower's colon on jan 5 said that after the operation he advised tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner -- a

swelled into a beltway monster politics never has been for the squeamish but the tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings which mostly took place in the '70s anyway were the writing less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy consequences might have been a classic case study of late 20th-century politics out of control given mr tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence patriotism and past chairmanship of the armed services committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors instead it sank like the bismarck clearly and apparently to his surprise mr tower had made many enemies since his arrival in washington in 1961 often rubbing even supporters the wrong way the senator from the lone star state

his wife it was reported that mr tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at bergstrom air force base the second wife whom the senator had recently divorced possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered at his hotel mr tower was accorded that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status the media stakeout the nominee issued fervent denials he drank only wine having long since sworn off scotch he'd never chased secretaries his services for defense-industry clients had been proper and modest none of the charges at least on mr tower's showing proved to

no position pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts containing the distasteful specifics of mr secchia's remarks at his confirmation hearing earlier this month secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast but pell said he was unpersuaded tact and careful speech

84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by senate democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many gop contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for foreign service professionals gildenhorn said friday he could not comment because he is in a confirmation process a report prepared by the state department for the foreign relations committee said gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management it also cited another qualification mr gildenhorn has been a strong republican supporter being a member of the eagles and team 100 the state department said the republican eagles are contributors of $10000 or more in a

contributed more than $100000 to republican candidates and causes mrs newman served as chairman of the washington state bush for president committee ambassador david popper president of the academy of diplomacy declined to confirm that gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors but he said the academy does offer such ratings making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirements of the job he said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the united states abroad with dignity respect and ability twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals many of them large contributors to republican causes committee sources said sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services political throwaways sarbanes calls them i think the time has come very frankly to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination sarbanes told the committee last month it's not true in every instance but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $100000 mark in order to make the consideration list sarbanes said sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such noting that many of them compiled distinguished records it is not the political ambassadors that are the problem sarbanes said it is ambassadors without qualifications ap890801-0134 ap-nr-08-01-89 2053edt r i

city after the dec 20 invasion of panama by us forces and installation of guillermo endara as president independent observers mostly concluded endara had won the elections by a hefty margin bush named hinton as a recess appointment because congress is not in session that means hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the senate for confirmation the appointment of the 66-year-old hinton with his long expierience on latin american issues is seen as a signal of the importance bush is placing on restoring normal relations with panama those relations steadily deteriorated after the united states indicted noriega once a ally particularly of the us intelligence community on drug trafficking charges in florida hinton has been ambassador to costa rica since 1987 before that he was ambassador to pakistan from 1983 to 1987 and ambassador to el salvador from 1981 to 1983 he was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from 1979 to 1981

said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to mrs chamorro who takes office wednesday they also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts only rarely have us ambassadorships in latin america gone to women in choosing ms wells the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region said the sources who asked not to be identified ms wells who was born in estonia has no prior experience in latin america her personnel record indicates she speaks spanish wells' name was submitted to the white house by secretary of state james a baker iii for the managua post and approval is considered 999 percent certain one source said the united states and nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since july 1988 the sandinista government expelled then-us ambassador richard melton and seven other us diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in nicaragua's internal affairs the reagan administration retaliated by expelling nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the nicaraguan embassy here but a new era in us-nicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of mrs chamorro who defeated president daniel ortega in elections this february vice president dan quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent bush at her inaugural the administration has asked congress for $300 million in assistance to nicaragua part of which would be used for resettling contra rebels but the request has been stalled by senate democrats some of whom believe that eastern europe has a greater claim on us resources than nicaragua wells' nomination as ambassador to mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against us policy toward that country the nomination finally was approved in september 1987 sen jesse helms

harry shlaudeman as the first us ambassador to nicaragua in almost two years a us official says the administration had planned to send another career diplomat melissa wells to managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives the administration is eager to have an ambassador in managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that us-backed president violeta chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist sandinista party mrs chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare the united states has had no ambassador to nicaragua since july 1988 at the time the sandinista government expelled ambassador richard melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs the reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight nicaraguan envoys in washington including ambassador carlos tunnermann shlaudeman who has served as ambassador to argentina peru brazil and venezuela is a premier state department specialist on latin america and is expected to win easy senate confirmation he retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a state department liaison with the nicaraguan contra rebels shlaudeman who will turn 64 next week was approached by a senior state department official weeks ago about going to managua but said he was not interested he told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by president bush when bush telephoned him earlier this week shlaudeman agreed to the appointment the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said wednesday in addition to his ambassadorial posts shlaudeman was the top latin america aide to president ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in central america under president reagan the us official said sen jesse helms r-nc and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay wells' nomination when wells was nominated to be ambassador to mozambique in late 1986 helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 months they took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the reagan

jordan wesley egan is a heavyweight once the second man in the us embassy in cairo he also served in saudi arabia two african countries and a european nation his choice for the new job signals the importance the united states attaches to jordan in terms of inter-arab politics and the arab-israeli dispute before egan's appointment became final he had to go through a grueling test in the us senate where senator daniel moynihan the zionist democrat from new york presided over the hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials and went on to confirm his nomination in his testimony egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the united states and jordan and enhance jordan's role in the peace process he pointed out that jordan signed a joint agenda with israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries his said his top priority in amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize jordan's energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive middle east peace mr egan will pay special attention to stability in jordan and watch its democratic march and economic development he will also watch jordan's approach to a number of other issues human rights compliance with the sanctions resolution against iraq terminating the boycott of us companies doing business with israel the potential for foreign investment both in jordan and elsewhere in the region and the fight against terrorism much as i take exception to some of the issues that will engage the new ambassador's attention i concern myself here with a lecture moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing discussing the west bank and gaza he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories and asked if these are occupied territories who were they occupied by these territories contended the senator were never the sovereign domain of anyone it was jordan that occupied the west bank at the founding of the state of israel what israel did was to take the west bank from jordan the way it took gaza from egypt previously these territories were part of the british mandate and before that they fell within the realm of the ottoman empire mr moynihan's point in other words is that these territories are up for grabs the united states he noted never recognized jordan's sovereignty over the west bank his bottom line israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's sovereignty this zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be washington's official line however they do mirror an undeclared us line dictated by the all-powerful zionist lobby -- a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting stance of the united states toward the un security council resolution

an important one india and its neighbor pakistan remain embroiled in a long bitter feud that has the potential of becoming one of the world's few remaining nuclear standoffs mr pickering was one of president bush's first ambassadorial appointments he served at the un during the time the administration was involved in the delicate negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition against iraq in the persian gulf war and the un sanctions against saddam hussein's regime but some senior state department officials have been irritated by what they call mr pickering's propensity for the media spotlight during the 1980s when the reagan administration drew the line against communist-backed insurgences in central america mr pickering played an active role in that effort as us envoy to el salvador mr perkins was the us ambassador to south africa in 1986 when the us imposed economic sanctions against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid mr perkins

sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by heseltine who last week stopped mrs thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race mrs thatcher had not wanted to leave office but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down heseltine's challenge she said she resigned to let someone from the cabinet stand against heseltine major and foreign secretary douglas

thatcherism with a different face the conservatives' main rivals the socialist labor party demanded a general election john major is a thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected said labor party leader neil kinnock it means that the policies that brought the poll tax recession heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on during his five-day campaign major had aaid he would review the poll tax an unpopular local tax brought in by mrs thatcher but he gave no other hints of differing with her while adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of britain's involvement in europe he shares her opposition to a single european currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending however he insisted over the weekend i am not running as `son of thatcher' i am running as myself with my own priorities and my own programs major's victory ended a patient four-year campaign by heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of

to dispel doubts among tory mps about his chances of staying in office right-wing mps confirmed the findings in an independent on sunday/nop national opinion poll poll that michael heseltine was the favourite to replace mr major if he is forced out but they are calculating that michael portillo will run hard to secure eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner some of mr major's closest allies were seething with anger at mr heseltine and kenneth clarke the chancellor for posturing before the damaging retreat last week by the prime minister over britain's veto powers in the enlarged european union why were clarke and heseltine trying to sound more portilloesque than portillo the answer's pretty obvious said one cabinet minister the leadership is hoping that over the easter recess the conservative constituencies will urge their mps to stop the damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the government's fightback on the economy law and order and education that message was reinforced by three cabinet ministers who broke their easter sundays to support mr major john patten the secretary of state for education said he is a man of very great resilience it must be tough for him no one likes the level of criticism he has been getting but he will be carrying on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next general election michael howard the home secretary said there is no prospect of any leadership contest john major is going to lead the conservative party successfully into the next general election he dismissed one poll of 100 mps which showed that 41 of them believed there would be a change of leadership lord wakeham leader of the house of lords used a letter to his former constituency of colchester south to issue a general call to tories for loyalty to mr major our support for him should not only be loyalty to a proven winner but also backing for a man who has ideas ambitions and ability to take britain to success in the 21st century lord wakeham said their calls were described as ritualistic by one leading right-wing tory mp john major has done himself great damage there will not be a coup next week it will depend on how we do in the local and european elections but there will be a stalking horse candidate this autumn there's little doubt about that he said however tory right wingers said last night that they would support mr major because there was no credible right-wing candidate mr portillo 40 was too young and they still regarded mr heseltine as an interventionist left-winger if a challenge does take place they will press mr portillo to stand to secure key commitments including no british entry into a single european currency three of the tory mps who have been rumoured as possible stalking horses --

yesterday the conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats as the ruling party the tories took just 27 percent of the vote two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls the results of the local elections showed that the tories were reduced to the third party nationally behind the liberal democrats and the labour party the labour party controls 90 local councils whereas the conservatives only control 13 with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides the liberal democrats had a net gain of 378 seats even some former conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the liberal democrats of course this was a measure taken by tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents who resent the tories to vote for the liberal democrats rather than labour in the deep sorrow of defeat some conservatives are secretly feeling happy they resent john major's leadership and would most willingly link major's incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections even before all of the results were known some tories openly announced their determination to challenge john major's position and remove him from office as early as possible the right-winger michael portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the european issue and highlighted john major's image as a loser who fails to command obviously all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making john major suffer an even greater defeat in the european parliament elections scheduled for 9 june before 9 june nobody will officially challenge for the position of party leader but he who is in office must suffer the pain of electoral defeat after 9 june john major will have to answer for all of the disasters and it is time to use him as a scapegoat john major is someone who was propped up by mrs thatcher who supported appointing the mediocre john major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the thatcher line nevertheless people around john major seriously pushed him to betray thatcher's doctrine while pursuing entirely new leftist policies and affecting john major's moves for a very long period right-wingers and left-wingers argued over many domestic and world issues john major has always been weak and powerless and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own crisis of honor on the european issue he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty cultural traditions and life-style of each country of the future european union while reflecting the islanders' mind set on the one hand he expressed the will to join the european family on the other he made one big stride closer to the right while great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered on both sides john major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance when expounding on such concepts he set out a campaign to return to basic values with an emphasis on citizen self-discipline taking social responsibility and obligations and being upright however one scandal surfaced after another in his cabinet consequently british citizens saw how bombastic major could be and how he failed to know himself the scandals caused major's reputation to collapse for a long time john major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of british people who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment at this critical juncture john major went back on promises made during the election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic fuel as a result things became even harder for the poor he promised to reduce public expenditure but on the contrary it rose by 455 percent as published john major has become an expert in making empty promises while constituents continue to scorn this dishonest prime minister many conservatives believe that john major is driven by a gambler's mind set at a time when his reputation was waning he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world issues regardless of british national strength this being the case he wanted to try his luck in bosnia as well as policy toward china however he was helpless in dealing with domestic economic issues which would only lead britain to an impasse it will be difficult for john major to lead the tories in the next general election therefore news spread earlier this year that john major would be replaced the setback which has resulted from defeats in the local elections is heavier than expected to accelerate a leadership reshuffle conservatives have spread the opinion that john major is not up to his office however if politicians from various factions compete for office by taking a laissez-faire attitude the tory unity will be jeopardized this being the case a planned transfer of power especially the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the party chairman is necessary when the new party chairman is elected the question of who will replace john major will be settled too word has spread that john major wants chris patten to become conservative party chairman however this proposal was rejected that should have been a party secret making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality namely many conservatives did not agree to chris patten contending for this position there are no grounds to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral circumstances that would only aggravate the tory's poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents in actual fact should john major set out such a line in appointing people that would only give more evidence of his poor ability insight and lack of judgment as well as his self-knowledge now it is just a matter of time until he leaves office but nobody will let him make arrangements for the transfer of power work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran tories how can john major be qualified for such a task ft932-15960 _an-ddhb2acift 930408 ft 08 apr 93 / john major's year

unpopular leader who has everything still to prove the past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over europe by the debacle surrounding uk withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the european monetary system and by a continuing deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional tory supporters in business mr major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record while mr tony newton leader of the commons conceded 'no one pretends that the last year has been easy' he also claimed that much had been achieved the government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off mr john smith the labour leader was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in launching a counter-attack involving a detailed and documented indictment of mr major's failures he attacked the tories for building 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments' tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends yesterday sir michael angus president of the confederation of british industry remained cautious but volunteered 'if i were a betting man i would say we have the embryo of a recovery' mr major can take little comfort from the conclusion widespread among industrialists that his greatest achievement in the past year has been britain's withdrawal from the erm - something which he resisted and over which in the end he had no control most industrialists however find it hard to criticise mr major as an individual with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor he still attracts gratitude for the election victory which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the economy - as the best result for business but unlike the previous no 10 occupant he is seen as a weak leader with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction there is a general perception that important though britain's future place in europe is the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions to the detriment of the domestic economy many industrialists are pleased that mr major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in

been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with michael brunson itn's political editor in which major used a variety of four- six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues may do him good with luck it is reckoned major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction what piffle major is a gonner especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the christchurch by-election where a conservative majority of 23015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16427 majority for the liberal democrats fifteen months too late the voters of christchurch rounded on the tories with a malignant and squeaky fury in reality all politicians not just major are far more candid and salty when chatting in

expletives or obscenities is discouraged four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review arts pages' i can live with that though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle first i tackled major i said 'did you read john what olivier blanchard rudiger dornbusch stanley fischer franco modigliani paul a samuelson and robert solow wrote in just one article in the ft this week they were describing europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements they did not pull their punches i bet you went chalk-white 'so why not walk the plank john you are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century why invite more punishment unfairly or not you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses let

invented himself by dominic lawson last year a biography of mrs norma major - or if we are being old-fashioned mrs john major - claimed that the majors' favourite film was being there i entirely concur with their choice in case you did not see that marvellous film this in essence was the plot a man no one knows anything about a gardener called chauncey rises without trace to become by the end of the film a serious candidate for the us presidency chauncey played by peter sellers utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner in chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe he has a deadly innocence no wonder the majors liked this film john major must at some level have appreciated the similarity between his own strangely intangible rise and that of chauncey's if he did not see the similarity that is still more revealing do not protest that the urban john major could not identify with a gardener in an interview with farmers weekly a few days ago major disclosed an unknown fact his father was once a farmer farmers weekly you see had asked major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture' well it was obvious to farmers weekly anyway and major replied 'it's simple my father was a farmer he lived on a small farm somewhere in shropshire' francis wheen of the guardian a keen student of major's mysterious past immediately rang 10 downing street which claimed that major's father farmed near bromsgrove in 1910 as wheen pointed out major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time and - a minor point this - bromsgrove is not in shropshire this of course does not mean that major made everything up family folklore is a peculiar thing yet when i heard about this my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago when major visited pittsburgh centre of the us steel industry as part of his american tour i recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city a farmer for farmers weekly a pittsburgh steelworker for the american audience a pattern emerges major's father and therefore by extension john major himself can be all things to all people if john major were a different sort of politician this would be a point barely worth making but it does seem all of a piece with major's approach to wider political issues on the one hand he will appeal to the pro-europeans in his own party by claiming to want britain to be at the heart of europe on the other he is free with insulting references to the european commission whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of euro-sceptics there are those who will argue that this merely means that major is a typical democratic politician that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest not just one but that has not been true of major's most recent conservative predecessors margaret thatcher was notoriously dogmatic even in public and so too was edward heath even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician' no major's technique is very much his own invention very much a reflection of his own particular character itself a product of his unsettled family background his father tom major-ball was an itinerant figure moving from place to place trying his hand at any number of occupations including the circus no wonder the young john major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances no matter how fluctuating

opponent that vote -- while she was in paris attending the summit meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe -- forced her into a runoff with heseltine and ultimately cost her the party leadership but in that vote under the party's complicated rules she needed a majority plus 15% and she fell four votes short in tuesday's ballot only a simple majority was needed to win outright the prime minister's downfall came after she had run into a stretch of unpopularity -- partly through her authoritarian manner partly because of inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new poll tax she also appeared to take an anti-european attitude toward her 11 partners in the european community which caused her long-serving cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister geoffrey howe to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech that speech led heseltine who had walked out of the cabinet in 1984 in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor to challenge thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last tuesday the prime minister's failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to reassess her position her closest advisers reported that her support in the house of commons was eroding friends said so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues at that point on thursday morning both major and hurd loyal members of her cabinet entered the race against heseltine many tories in parliament were angry at heseltine for his role in bringing down thatcher who had won three national elections during her 15 years as conservative party leader her 11 1/2-year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century her confrontational style of
